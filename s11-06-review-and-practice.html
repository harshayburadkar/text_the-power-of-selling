        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch08_s06_p02">Now it’s time to put what you’ve learned into practice. Following are two roles that are involved in the same selling situation; one role is that of the sales manager and the other is that of the salesperson. This will give you the opportunity to think about this selling situation from the point of view of both the sales manager and the salesperson.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch08_s06_p03">Read each role carefully along with the discussion questions. Then, be prepared to play either of the roles in class using the concepts covered in this chapter. You may be asked to discuss the roles and role-play in groups or individually.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch08_s06_p05">You are the sales manager for GreenWay Lighting. Your product, LED lighting, can save companies up to 30 percent on their lighting bills starting in the first year after purchase. Target customers are industrial companies, such as manufacturers, that have large facilities. One of your sales reps would like to have a brainstorming session with you, the marketing director, product manager, and several other sales reps before approaching a new prospect, JR Papermills. Before the brainstorming session, you meet with the sales rep to discuss the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch08_s06_l03">
            <li>What information has the sales rep gathered about JR Papermills, and why is the company a good prospect?</li>
            <li>What information has the sales rep gathered about the person with whom he is meeting at JR Papermills?</li>
            <li>What are the SMART objectives that the sales rep has developed for the first sales call?</li>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch08_s06_p07">Your company markets and sells energy-efficient LED lighting to businesses and other facilities. You have qualified JR Papermills as a prospect due to the size of the facility (500,000 square feet), number of lights (one million), and plans for expansion (new manufacturing plant planned to be operational by the end of next year). You’ve done your homework about the company, and you learned that they always like to invest in products that give them a return in the first year after purchase. You want to set up a brainstorming session with several people in the company to help develop ideas you can use when you approach this prospect.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch08_s06_l04">
            <li>How will you convince your sales manager that JR Papermills is a promising prospect that is worth taking the time for a brainstorming session?</li>
            <li>If you want to gather more information about the prospect, where would you go to learn more about the company? Where would you go to learn more about the person with whom you are going to meet?</li>
            <li>How would you use your preapproach research to structure a brainstorming session?</li>
