Today, it’s even more complex with business being conducted around the world and with varying communication methods. In this constant, high-speed business environment, communication blunders can cost you more than you might think. Did you ever hear the saying, “You only have one chance to make a good first impression”? It couldn’t be truer when it comes to communication: The first two seconds of communication are so important that it takes another four minutes to add 50 percent more information to an impression—positive or negative—within that communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_001">Dave Rothfield, “Communicating Simply, Directly Will Improve You, Your Business,” <em class="emphasis">Orlando Business Journal</em>, May 15, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://orlando.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2009/05/18/smallb2.html?t=printable">http://orlando.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2009/05/18/smallb2.html?t=printable</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span> Communication has often been referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">soft skill</a><span class="glossdef">A term that relates to a person’s communication skills, social graces, personality traits, language abilities, and the ability to work with others.</span></span>, which includes other competencies such as social graces, personality traits, language abilities, and ability to work with other people.

In fact, it is almost impossible to be in sales without developing relationships inside your organization and with your customers. Your relationship skills build trust, allow you to be a true partner, and help solve your customer’s problems; both internal trust and external communication are essential keys to your ability to deliver on your promises. How are these qualities intrinsically related? The way in which you communicate can determine the level of trust that your colleagues or customers have in you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_005">Gail Fann Thomas, Roxanne Zoliln, and Jackie L. Harman, “The Central Role of Communication in Developing Trust and Its Effect on Employee Involvement,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communication</em> 46, no. 3 (July 2009): 287.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Just like relationships are the cornerstone of trust, communication is the foundation of relationships. But it’s difficult to establish and develop relationships; it takes work and a lot of clear communication. You might think that sounds simple, but consider this: Nearly 75 percent of communications that are received are interpreted incorrectly. At the same time, interestingly, many people consider themselves good communicators. The telling disconnect occurs because people tend to assume that they know what other people mean or people assume that others know what they mean. This is compounded by the fact that people tend to hear what they want to hear—that is, a person may interpret elements of a conversation in such a way that the taken meanings contribute to his already established beliefs. When you put these assumptions together, communication can easily become “miscommunication.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_006">Patricia M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Communication Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_p01">The standard model of communication has evolved based on two parties—the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sender</a><span class="glossdef">Person who originates a message or communication.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">receiver</a><span class="glossdef">Person who is the intended recipient of a message or communication.</span></span>—exchanging information or ideas. The model includes major processes and functions categorized as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">encoding</a><span class="glossdef">The process of converting a message to be sent to a receiver into a symbolic form such as letters, pictures, or language.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decoding</a><span class="glossdef">The process of converting an encoded message into meaning on the part of the receiver.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">response</a><span class="glossdef">An action taken by the receiver in response to a message.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">feedback</a><span class="glossdef">The method of providing information back to the sender in response the message.</span></span>. In addition, the model accounts for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noise</a><span class="glossdef">Anything that can interfere with the communication of a message between sender and receiver.</span></span>, which symbolizes anything that might disrupt the sending or receiving of a message.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_007">George E. Belch and Michael A. Belch, <em class="emphasis">Advertising and Promotion: An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective</em>, 8th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2009), 146.</span> The communication model is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_f01">Figure 5.1 "Traditional Communication Process"</a>.</p>

Solomon, Greg W. Marshall, and Elnora W. Stewart, <em class="emphasis">Marketing: Real People, Real Choices</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 378.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_p02">The model helps describe exactly how communication takes place. For example, if you send a text message to your friend to ask him if he wants to go a movie, you are the source, or sender, of the message. You translated or encoded your message into text characters. A personal digital assistant (PDA) such as a BlackBerry, iPhone, or cell phone is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">channel</a><span class="glossdef">The method by which a message is communicated.</span></span>, or the method by which you communicated your message. Chances are, if your friend does not have his PDA or cell phone with him, your message will not reach him, and you might miss the movie. So in this example, the PDA or cell phone is the channel. When your friend, the receiver, reads the message, he decodes it or determines what you meant to communicate, and then he responds. If he was talking to another friend while he was reading your text message and didn’t see the time the movie started, that conversation would be considered noise because it would be interfering with the communication of your message. Noise interferes with communication or causes distraction, whether it is heard or seen. When your friend responds to you by saying that he wants to go see the movie, he is providing feedback (or a response to your message). <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_f02">Figure 5.2 "Communication Process Example"</a> shows this example applied to the communication model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_p03">The same thing can happen in a selling situation. For example, if you call a prospect to set up a meeting, you are the sender. The message is the meeting information (e.g., date, time, and place) that you encode into words. The channel is the telephone, and the receiver is the prospect. It sounds easy enough. Assume, however, that the prospect responds to you and agrees to the meeting. But because he was checking his e-mails while he was talking to you (which is noise), he puts the wrong time on his calendar. When you come for the appointment, he’s out of the office, and your sales call doesn’t take place. Now you have to start the communication process all over again. This is only an example of simply setting up a meeting. Now imagine the challenges if you started explaining the features and benefits of a complex product or negotiating a contract. You can see why understanding the communication process is so important in selling.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p01">One of the key elements of being a good communicator is having empathy. That means thinking about your communication from the receiver’s point of view. It’s focusing on what <em class="emphasis">she</em> wants to learn as a result of your communication, not what you want to tell her. Empathy is about demonstrating that you care about the other person’s situation. Think about when you received your acceptance letter from your college; the letter probably mentioned what an exciting time it is in your life. The author of the letter demonstrated empathy because she focused on the situation from your perspective. A purely factual letter, without empathy, might have said that you were accepted and that now the school can make their budget since they met their enrollment goal. That would be quite a different letter and would make you feel very different (and probably not very welcome). Although it’s always best to be candid, you should deliver information from the receiver’s point of view and address her concerns.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_010">Steve Adubato, “Empathy Is Essential to Effective Communication,” NJBiz, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.stand-deliver.com/njbiz/2008/020408.pdf">http://www.stand-deliver.com/njbiz/2008/020408.pdf</a> (accessed July 14, 2009).</span></p>

(Keep in mind that when you are in sales, you <em class="emphasis">are</em> the brand to the customer.) It is especially important to have an emotional connection and empathy when apologizing to customers. Chances are the customer is already angry, or at least disappointed, when you are not able to deliver as expected. You can express empathy in your communications by saying or writing, “You have every right to be upset. I understand how you must feel. I apologize for the late delivery. Let’s work on a new process that will help prevent it from happening again.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_011">Mary Ellen Guffey, <em class="emphasis">Business Communication</em>, 6th ed.

Sometimes, people are trying to avoid “bad news” or trying to avoid taking a stand on a topic. It’s always best to avoid confusion and clearly say what you mean by framing your message in a way that is easily understood by all receivers. It’s also a good idea to avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">buzz words (or jargon)</a><span class="glossdef">Words, phrases, or acronyms that are used only in a company.</span></span>—those words, phrases, or acronyms that are used only in your company.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s05_p01">If you go to dinner at Cheesecake Factory and there is a wait to get a table, the hostess will hand you a portable pager and tell you that the wait will be twenty to twenty-five minutes. Perfect. You have just enough time to run a quick errand at a nearby store at the mall and be back in time to get your table. If, on the other hand, she told you that you will be seated shortly, you might have an expectation of being seated in five to ten minutes. Meanwhile, “shortly” might mean twenty to twenty-five minutes for her. You would probably forgo running your errand because you think you are going to be seated soon but end up waiting for twenty-five minutes and being frustrated. Being specific in your communication not only gives clarity to your message but also helps set your customer’s expectations. In other words, your customer won’t expect something you can’t deliver if you are clear about what exactly you <em class="emphasis">can</em> deliver and when. The same is true for prices. For example, if you order from the menu at the Cheesecake Factory, you know precisely what you will get to eat and how much it will cost. However, if there is a menu special that you heard about tableside, but weren’t told how much the dish was, you might be surprised (and disappointed) when you receive the check. Specificity avoids surprises and sets expectations.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s06_p01">Timing is everything in life and most certainly in selling. It’s best to be proactive with communication, and if you owe someone a response, do it sooner rather than later. If you are slow to respond to questions and communication, it will be difficult to develop trust, as prolonged responses may seem to imply that you are taking action without informing the customer what it is you are doing. Timing is especially important when you are communicating a negative response or bad news. Don’t put it off; do it as soon as possible and give your customer the benefit of complete information.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Listen Up</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p01">While you may think you are ready to communicate, it’s a good idea to stop and listen first. Creating your message is only half of communication; listening is the other half. But it’s difficult to listen because we listen faster than we speak—that is, based on what the other person is saying, we are already constructing responses in our minds before they have even finished. As a result, many people are guilty of “listening too fast.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_014">Jeffrey J. Denning, “How to Improve Your Listening Skills, Avoid Mix-ups,” <em class="emphasis">Ophthalmology Times</em> 26, no. 10 (May 15, 2001): 28.</span> Cicero once said that it is good thing that humans were given one mouth and two ears, in light of the way we use them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_015">Patricia M. Buhler, “Managing in the New Millennium: Six Tips to More Effective Communication,” <em class="emphasis">Supervision</em> 70, no. 7 (July 2009): 19.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p02">Listening, in fact, is so important that companies like Starbucks believe that it may directly improve profits. According to Alan Gulick, a Starbucks Corporation spokesperson, if every Starbucks employee misheard one $10 order each day, it would cost the company one billion dollars in a year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_016"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span> That’s why Starbucks has a process to teach their employees how to listen. Although listening may seem passive, it is actively linked to success: One study conducted in the insurance industry found that better listeners held higher positions and got promoted more than those who did not have developed listening skills.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_017">Beverly Davenport Sypher, Robert N. Bostrom, and Joy Hart Seibert, “Listening, Communication Abilities and Success at Work,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communication</em> 26, no. 4 (Fall 1989): 293.</span> So it’s worth it to hone your listening skills <em class="emphasis">now</em> so that when you get into the business world you can be successful. Here are a few tips:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use active listening</strong>. Confirm that you heard the sender correctly by saying something like, “Just to be sure I understand, we are going to move forward with twelve cases for your initial order, then revisit your inventory in five days.” Review the communication model above and take notice of the importance of decoding. If you decode a message from your customer incorrectly, the communication is ineffective and could even be costly. In the example above, the customer might have said in response, “I meant that the initial order should be five cases, and we’ll revisit the inventory in twelve days.” That’s a big difference.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask questions</strong>. Questions are a way to gather more information and learn about your customer and their business. They are also an excellent way to demonstrate that you are communicating by listening. You learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a> that asking the <em class="emphasis">right</em> questions is critical to being a successful salesperson. Focus on listening and asking the right questions, and you’ll be rewarded with great information.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Focus</strong>. Although multitasking has seemingly become a modern virtue, focus actually helps create more effective communication. Stop and focus on your customer when he is speaking. This is a sign of respect, and this concentration allows you to absorb more information. Take notes to remember exactly what you discussed. There’s nothing more important than what your customer has to say.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_018">Jeffrey J. Denning, “How to Improve Your Listening Skills, Avoid Mix-ups,” <em class="emphasis">Ophthalmology Times</em> 26, no. 10 (May 15, 2001): 28.</span>
</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take notes</strong>. While it may seem like you will remember everything that is said at a meeting or during a conversation, taking notes signals that you are listening, and it provides you with an accurate record of what was said. “The palest ink is better than the best memory.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_019">“A Lesson on Listening,”Selling Power Pharmaceuticals eNewsletter, April 9, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=814">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=814</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_p01">It’s important to remember that you will be communicating with many different people about many different topics in selling. Sometimes, you will be communicating one-on-one and sometimes you will be communicating with a group. Just as people have varying social styles (as you’ve learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>), it’s important to know that people also absorb information differently. Research conducted in the 1970s indicates that people comprehend information in four distinct ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Why</strong>. They want to know the reasons for doing something.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What</strong>. They want to know the facts about it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How</strong>. They want to know only the information they need to get it done.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What if</strong>. They want to know the consequences of doing it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_p02">This can be a helpful road map of the elements you will want to include in your communications, especially if you are communicating with a group, since you may not know everyone’s best method of absorbing information. It’s been proven that if people don’t receive the type of communication they prefer, they tend to tune out or reject the information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_p03">You’ve probably noticed that both people and brands communicate the same message multiple times and usually in multiple ways. Creative repetition is key to successful communication. Think about the advertising Pepsi ran when it launched its new logo in early 2009; you most likely saw the television commercial during the Super Bowl, noticed a billboard in a high-traffic area of a major city, received an e-mail, saw banner ads on the Internet, reviewed the commercial on YouTube, and saw the new logo on the packaging. Pepsi’s ad campaign illustrates the “three-times convincer” concept, which claims that 80 percent of people need to be exposed a message three times to buy into it, 15 percent need to be exposed to it five times, and 5 percent need to be exposed to it up to twenty-five times.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_022">Natalie Zmuda, “Pepsi, Coke Try to Outdo Each Other with Rays of Sunshine,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, January 19, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=133859">http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=133859</a> (accessed July 14, 2009).</span> You may have seen the message so many times that it’s hard to remember what the old logo even looked like.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_p01">It is important to use multiple types of communication so that repetition does not become boring like a broken record.

        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Verbal Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p01">An introduction, a presentation, a telephone conversation, a videoconference call: these are all examples of verbal communication because information is transmitted orally. Despite the ubiquitous use of technology in the business world, verbal communication is the most common method of exchanging information and ideas. Verbal communication is powerful, fast, and natural and includes voice inflections that help senders and receivers understand the message more clearly. The downside to verbal communication is that once it is spoken, the words are essentially gone; they are preserved only in the memory of those present, and sometimes the memories of the specific words spoken vary dramatically. The he-said-she-said argument is an example of this. No one really knows who said what unless the words are recorded. Recall is rarely exactly the same between two or more people.</p>

In fact, the same words can take on completely different meaning based on the inflection you use. For example, if you say the sentence in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_f01">Figure 5.4 "The Impact of Intonation"</a> with an inflection on a different word each time, the sentence communicates something completely different each time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p06">Verbal communication may take place face-to-face, such as an in-person conversation or group meeting, speech, or presentation. It could also take place by phone in an individual conversation, a conference call, or even a voice mail. Other forms of verbal communication include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">videoconferences</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting that takes place in at least two remote locations and includes technology support to see and hear people in all locations simultaneously.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">podcasts</a><span class="glossdef">An audio broadcast transmitted via an MP3 player.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Webinars</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting that takes place on the Internet that allows participants in remote locations to view what is on the screen and hear the speaker and ask questions.</span></span>, which are increasingly common in business. All these methods allow you to use inflection to communicate effectively. Face-to-face meetings also provide the opportunity to use and interpret other visual cues to increase the effectiveness of your communication.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p09">Verbal communication is especially important throughout the steps of the selling process. Your choice of words can make the difference in someone’s decision to first hear your sales presentation, and your presentation can determine whether that person will purchase your product or service. You will learn more specifically about how communication is used throughout the selling process covered in later chapters.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p01">Imagine that you are in a retail store buying a suit for an interview. When the salesperson approaches you, she smiles, makes eye contact, and shakes your hand. You respond positively. You notice that she is dressed professionally, so she makes you feel as if you will receive good fashion advice from her. When you make your choice, the tailor comes over wearing a tape measure around his neck. You know he is a professional and you can trust him to alter your new suit properly. On the other hand, if the salesperson waits on you only after you interrupt her personal phone call, doesn’t make eye contact or shake your hand, acts as if she is bored being at work, and is dressed in worn jeans and flip-flops, it’s unlikely that you trust her to help you choose your suit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p02">You have, no doubt, used and noticed nonverbal communication in virtually every personal encounter you have had. Think about it: A gesture, a smile, a nod, eye contact, what you are wearing, the fact that you are frequently checking your cell phone for text messages, and how close you stand to someone are all examples of nonverbal communication.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p03">Nonverbal communication is extremely powerful. In fact, some studies indicate that the influence from nonverbal communication such as tone and visuals can have a greater impact than the spoken words. Dr. Albert Mehrabian, a famed psychologist and professor emeritus of psychology at University of California, Los Angeles, is considered a pioneer in the area of body language and nonverbal communication. His research includes an equation, called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Mehrabian formula</a><span class="glossdef">Formula used to explain situations in which verbal communication and nonverbal communication do not match; in other words, when facial expressions contradict words, people tend to believe the facial expressions.</span></span>,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_025">Albert Mehrabian, “Silent Messages,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kaaj.com/psych/smorder.html">http://www.kaaj.com/psych/smorder.html</a> (accessed July 15, 2009).</span> that is frequently used to define the relative impact of verbal and nonverbal messages based on experiments of communication of feelings and attitudes.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Dress for success</strong> at all times, which means always dressing appropriately for the situation. The <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in this chapter covers how to dress for an interview. But it’s best to keep in mind that even after you get the job you want, it’s a good idea to dress a little better than the position. Even in very casual work environments, what you wear is a nonverbal communication about who you are. If you don’t dress for the next promotion, chances are you won’t be considered for it. Be aware of the company policy and dress code, and if in doubt, dress more conservatively. This podcast featuring Peter Post discusses how to handle casual dress in the workplace.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p05">Although verbal communication is faster and more natural than written communication, each has its pros and cons. Generally, written communication is better at conveying facts, while verbal communication is better at conveying feelings. Verbal communication has another significant drawback: consider the fact that humans listen much faster than they speak. For example, the average public speaker speaks at about 125 words per minute. Although this sounds natural, the average person can listen at 400 to 500 words per minute. That means that listeners’ minds have time and space to wander, which can impact the effectiveness of verbal communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_039"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span> (You may have noticed your mind wandering during a class lecture—even if you found the topic interesting.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p06">Written communication requires a good command of the English language, including the rules of grammar and spelling. If you think that business exists solely on quick instant messages and text messages, you might be surprised to learn that they are only a portion of the communication within a company and between the company’s vendors and other partners. Because the nature of written communication is such that it allows time for consideration and composition, the standards for writing are much higher than for a casual conversation. Customers and colleagues alike expect clear, concise written communications with proper grammar and spelling. And because written communication is long lasting—whether on paper or on the Internet—errors or misstatements exist for an irritatingly long time. So whether you are writing a proposal, a presentation, a report, a meeting recap, or a follow-up e-mail, it’s best to take the time to think about your communication and craft it so that it is effective. Consider using the following tips:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be short and sweet</strong>. Shorter is always better when it comes to business correspondence. It’s best to include all pertinent facts with concise information. If you write your communication with the receiver in mind, it will be easier to make it shorter and more effective.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Grammar, please</strong>. Sentences should be structured correctly and use proper grammar, including a subject and a verb in each sentence. Business correspondence should always include uppercase and lowercase letters and correct punctuation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_040">Patricia M. Buhler, “Managing in the New Millennium: Six Tips to More Effective Communication,” <em class="emphasis">Supervision</em> 70, no. 7 (July 2009): 19.</span> If writing is not your strong suit, visit your campus student services office or learning center to provide information about upcoming writing clinics and access to other tools that can help improve your writing skills.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Check spelling</strong>. Use the spell-check tool on your computer. There is no excuse for a misspelled word. Text abbreviations are not acceptable in business correspondence.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read before you send</strong>. Reread your document or electronic communication before it goes out. Is everything complete? Is it clear? Is it something you will be proud of days or weeks later? Take the extra time to review before you send. It’s difficult to revise a communication as revisions cause confusion.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Just the facts</strong>. Stick to the facts to maximize the impact of your written communications; leave the emotional topics for verbal dialogue. For example, send an e-mail to confirm meeting time, date, and location; use a verbal communication for the content of the meeting to be discussed, such as a negotiation.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s04_p01">Although verbal, nonverbal, and written communication all play a role in your communication with your customers, you might be wondering which one is best. It depends on your customer and on the situation. Some customers want to work day to day using all the latest technology tools, including text messaging, social networking, Web conferences, wikis, and more. Other customers prefer more traditional face-to-face meetings, phone calls, and some e-mail correspondence. Adapt to the method of communication that your customer prefers and not the other way around. In some situations, a face-to-face meeting is best—for instance, if you wish to discuss a complex issue, negotiate, or meet some additional members of the team. Sometimes, a face-to-face meeting isn’t feasible, so other verbal communication methods such as a videoconference, phone call, or conference call can be efficient and effective if used properly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s04_p02">Chances are you will use a combination of communication types with each customer tailored to his particular preferences and situation. Be guided by the fact that you want to keep your communication personal in meaning and professional in content. Think about it from the receiver’s point of view, and deliver bad news verbally whenever possible.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s04_p03">It might seem intuitive, but it’s not always true that a face-to-face meeting is better than an e-mail. It depends on the type of relationship you have with the person. If you are competitive with her, it’s best to use e-mail to communicate. According to a study conducted by Robert B. Cialdini and Rosanna Guadagno in 2002, if you have a more cooperative relationship, a face-to-face meeting is probably a better choice if it’s physically possible.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_041">“Communicating Persuasively: Email or Face-to-Face,” PsyBlog, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/03/communicating-persuasively-email-or.php">http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/03/communicating-persuasively-email-or.php</a> (accessed July 15, 2009).</span></p>

                    <li>There are three types of <strong class="emphasis bold">communication</strong>: <strong class="emphasis bold">verbal</strong>, which involves speaking to one or many people to convey a message; <strong class="emphasis bold">nonverbal</strong>, which includes body language and other observations about people; and <strong class="emphasis bold">written</strong>, which includes a message that is read in hard copy, e-mail, text message, instant message, Facebook, Twitter, blog, or other Internet-based written communication.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Verbal communication</strong> provides the opportunity to change communication with inflection, or the emphasis put on certain words in a conversation or presentation.</li>

                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Written communication</strong> is best used for factual information, whereas <strong class="emphasis bold">verbal communication</strong> is best used for emotional topics or those that require discussion.</li>

                    <li>Test your listening skills. Do this exercise with a partner, one is the speaker and one is the listener. The speaker has three minutes to describe what he is looking for in a vacation destination. The listener has to use active listening skills. Then, the listener has three minutes to “sell” a destination to the speaker, based on what the speaker said he wanted. The speaker has one minute to review how close the listener was to his destination. Reverse roles and repeat.</li>
                    <li>Name the three types of communication and give an example for each one. How might the communication be misinterpreted in each example? How might the communication be made more effective in each example?</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p01">Despite the use of electronic devices in business, formal written communication such as letters, memos, proposals, reports, and presentations are still major methods of communication in selling. These more official methods of communication reflect factual statements that you are making on behalf of the company. Here are some tips for writing business communications:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Use company letterhead where appropriate. For example, letters are always written on letterhead, whether in hard copy or in an electronic format that can be sent via e-mail.</li>
                <li>Use the formal elements of a business letter shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.7 "Business Letter Format"</a>.</li>
                <li>For a company memo, use the company format. Most companies have a set format for hard copy and electronic memos. See an example of a company memo in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 5.8 "Company Memo Example"</a>.</li>
                <li>Spell-check and proofread your document carefully before you send it. Be sure it is complete and factually correct and does not include any grammar or spelling errors.</li>
                <li>Use CC to indicate the names of other people who should also receive a copy of the letter or memo. The term “CC” is short for “carbon copy,” which dates back to the days of typewriters when carbon paper was used to make multiple copies of a document. It can also mean “courtesy copy”: an additional copy provided to someone as a courtesy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_042">Mary Ellen Guffey, <em class="emphasis">Business Communication</em>, 6th ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s04_p01">The purpose of a business breakfast, lunch, or dinner is to get to know someone and build a relationship.

Table manners are a form of nonverbal communication, and impolite etiquette can reverse all the effort you have put into a relationship. Business meals are so important that many companies use business lunches or dinners as part of the interview process.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_p01">The year was 1982, and the world was just beginning to realize the amazing potential of computer technology. John Naisbitt wrote a book called <em class="emphasis">Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives</em>, where he coined the term “high tech, high touch,” which he defined as the contradictory state in which people are driven by technology yet long for human interaction.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_060">John Naisbitt, <em class="emphasis">Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives</em> (New York: Grand Central Publishing, 1998).</span> He wrote about how the United States has been transformed from being comfortable with technology to being intoxicated with technology, a state he calls the “Technologically Intoxicated Zone” in his 1999 book, <em class="emphasis">High Tech/High Touch</em>. You probably can’t imagine living without your cell phone or personal digital assistant (PDA), iPod, computer, or other electronic devices. In fact, it’s likely you can’t even remember what communication was like before the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Technology, with all of its efficiency and benefits, cannot, however, become a substitute for old-fashioned human efforts. “Technology makes <em class="emphasis">tasks</em> easier, but it does not make our <em class="emphasis">lives</em> easier,” according to July Shapiro in a recent article in <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_061">July Shapiro, “A Digital Myth: Technology Doesn’t Make Life Easier,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, May 11, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/digitalnext/post?article_id=136533">http://adage.com/digitalnext/post?article_id=136533</a> (accessed May 12, 2009).</span> Shapiro’s observation is true, especially as it relates to business; sometimes, the crush of technology takes precedence over business etiquette. However, people have begun to rethink the lack of personal interaction and its corresponding etiquette in the workplace. Yes, “there’s even an app for that”; a firm named Etiquette Avenue has recently launched an iPod app for business etiquette. The fact is, technology isn’t personal and can’t behave in the right way at the right time with your customer or on an interview; that’s completely up to <em class="emphasis">you</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_062">CommercialsKid, “iPhone 3g Commercial ‘There’s an App for That,’” video, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg</a> (accessed July 16, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_063">“Good Advice in Bad Times: New Etiquette Avenue iPhone App Puts Professional Protocol at Fingertips,” <em class="emphasis">Business Wire</em>, June 29, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_p03">Now, we’re seeing a bit of a reverse movement: Technology is so pervasive in selling that salespeople are actually pushing back on their managers and asking them for more face time and less gadget time. One of the best opportunities for sales managers and their salespeople to discuss business problems and build relationships with one another has traditionally been during “windshield time,” which is the time in the car driving between sales calls. “Sales reps report that the intrusion of technology has stolen this valuable time from reps and their principals [bosses],” according to a recent article in <em class="emphasis">Agency Sales</em>, because as soon as they get into the car to drive to the next call, the sales manager pulls out his BlackBerry. “If there’s one thing I could tell my principals [bosses] when they come see me in the field is to ditch the electronic communications and pay attention to me and our customers,” said one salesperson quoted in the article.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_064">“Reestablishing the Inside Connection: Open Communication with Inside Sales Strengthens the Rep Bond,” <em class="emphasis">Agency Sales</em> 39, no. 5: 38.</span> It’s no surprise that there’s a need for business etiquette, especially as it relates to technology.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p01">In a recent pitch to a potential client, a marketing executive in Manhattan thought it was strange that his potential customer was so engaged with his iPhone that he hardly looked up from it during the meeting. After ninety minutes, someone peeked over the customer’s shoulder and saw that he was playing a racing game on his iPhone. This was disappointing, but not shocking according to the marketing firm that was doing the presentation; they continued with their pitch because they wanted the business. Some are not as tolerant. Billionaire Tom Golisano, a power broker in New York politics, recently announced that he wants to have State Senate majority leader Malcolm A. Smith removed from office because Smith was focused on his BlackBerry during a budget meeting with him. Recently, in Dallas, Texas, a student lost his opportunity for an internship at a hedge fund when he checked his BlackBerry to check a fact during an interview and took an extra minute to check his text messages at the same time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_065">Alex Williams, “At Meetings, It’s Mind Your Blackberry or Mind Your Manners,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 22, 2009, A1.</span> It’s no surprise that BlackBerrys are also called “CrackBerrys.” According to Maggie Jackson, author of <em class="emphasis">Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age</em>, we are living in “an institutionalized culture of interruption, where our time and attention is being fragmented by a never-ending stream of phone calls, e-mails, instant messages, text messages, and tweets.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_066">Patrick Welsh, “Txting Away Ur Education,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, June 23, 2009, A11.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p02">The need to be connected should not overwhelm respect for colleagues and customers. Although texting has become a national pastime, especially among teenagers, it’s important to know the appropriate etiquette for the use of handheld electronic devices when conducting a sales call.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p03">First, it’s best to turn off your electronic devices <em class="emphasis">before</em> you enter every meeting. If you think you can’t live without checking your text messages, think about how you would feel if you went on a job interview and the person with whom you were meeting was checking his electronic device during your interview. Just because some people demonstrate bad behavior and check their electronic devices for messages during a meeting doesn’t make it appropriate. In fact, it will help you stand out as a good listener, and you will make your customer feel even more important when you focus exclusively on her, as shown in this video.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">Sometimes, however, the use of technology is entirely necessary to conduct business when personal interaction is impossible. It’s important that verbal communication that is not face-to-face is effective and professional. Because you don’t have the benefit of using or seeing the receiver’s nonverbal communication, the challenges for effective and appropriate communication are even greater.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s03_p01">Written communication has evolved to include multiple methods, all of which have appropriate places in selling. Notice the operative word here is <em class="emphasis">appropriate</em>. E-mail has become an accepted method of communication in most businesses, whereas text messages, instant messages, and social networks are commonplace for only some companies. That’s why etiquette is especially important when using any of these methods of communication, and you should take time to choose your method carefully. Letters, memos, proposals, and other written communication are considered formal, whether they are sent on paper or transmitted via e-mail. However, text messages, instant messages, and social networking are considered informal methods of communication and should be used only to communicate less formal information, such as a meeting time when schedules have been adjusted during a factory tour. Text and instant messages should never be used to communicate company policies, proposals, pricing, or other information that is important to conduct business with customers. It’s also worth noting that in all these methods your communication is permanent, so it’s a good idea to know the dos and don’ts of electronic communication.</p>

For example, a dissatisfied Virgin America passenger posted a tweet on Twitter during a flight to Boston, thanks to the Wi-Fi service onboard.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s04_l01">
                    <li>Proper <strong class="emphasis bold">etiquette</strong> is a necessity in selling. There are etiquette guidelines for virtually every form of communication, including conversations, meetings, business cards, business meals, thank-you notes, e-mails, text messages, and even social networking.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Written communication</strong> should always include proper grammar and spelling. This applies to formal business communications such as letters and memos, as well as informal business communications such as e-mails and text messages.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Written communication</strong> such as letters, reports, and memos are considered formal methods of business communication; many formal communications are transmitted via e-mail. Text messages, instant messages, blogs, and social networks are considered informal communications and should only be used for informal communications such as confirming a meeting place when noise is an issue, such as on a factory floor.</li>
                    <li>It’s best to remember that most <strong class="emphasis bold">written communication</strong> is permanent, so take the time to craft it carefully.</li>
                    <li>Professionalism should prevail in all business meetings and communications, including meals. When you are at a restaurant, it’s is good idea to remember BMW: <strong class="emphasis bold">B</strong>read to the left, <strong class="emphasis bold">M</strong>eal in the middle, <strong class="emphasis bold">W</strong>ater goblet to the right. Use silverware starting with the utensils on the outside and work your way in throughout the meal.</li>
                    <li>You can add a personal touch to a business relationship by sending a thank-you note. Although it is acceptable to send a thank-you note via e-mail, it is recommended to send a personal handwritten note to reflect a sincere sentiment that really stands out.</li>
                    <li>It is never appropriate to use an electronic device such as a cell phone, BlackBerry, or iPhone while you are talking with someone else. Turn off your devices before you enter a meeting.</li>
                    <li>When talking on the phone, be courteous and use an appropriate volume in your voice. Never discuss confidential or personal topics on the phone when others might overhear.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_p01">“Find someone who does what you want to do, then go talk to them.” That’s the advice that Ike Richman, vice president of public relations at Comcast-Spectacor consistently tells students when he is a guest speaker. That is the essence of what an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informational interview</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting with a professional to learn more about pursuing a career in a specific industry, profession, or job.</span></span> is: one-on-one communication that helps you learn about different industries and potential careers. You learned about the power of networking in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>. And informational interviews are one of the best ways to network. They are the ultimate in business communication because you are “trying on jobs for size to see if they fit you,” according to Richard Nelson Bolles, author of <em class="emphasis">What Color Is Your Parachute?</em> and the person who coined the term “informational interview.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_085">“Informational Interviewing Tutorial: Background Information about Informational Interviews,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is an Informational Interview?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s01_p01">An informational interview is exactly what it sounds like; it’s an opportunity to learn about a particular profession, industry, or job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_086">“Informational Interviewing Tutorial: Background Information about Informational Interviews,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span> That means that if you are interested in sales, you might meet with an account manager for a software company and talk to her about what it’s like to be in sales. Or, if you think you want to pursue a job in advertising, you could meet with someone who works at an advertising agency. This gives you the chance to learn the inside story about what it takes to start a career and work in your target industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s01_p02">You’ve probably learned about several different professions in your classes; you most likely heard from guest speakers. And through your networking activities, chances are you’ve met people who do what you think you want to do. But it’s impossible to know exactly what career you want to pursue without getting some one-on-one information. What does the job entail? Will you be working with people out in the field or sitting at a desk? What kinds of opportunities are available for personal development? What kind of skills and experience do you need? Is this really a career you will enjoy? What’s the best part of the job? What’s the worst part of the job? All these are excellent questions to ask during an informational interview.

<em class="emphasis bolditalic">How</em> to Ask for an Informational Interview</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s03_p01">Informational interviews are usually twenty to thirty minutes long and can take place in person or by phone. Once you identify the people with whom you would like to have an informational interview, it’s time to contact each person and ask for a meeting. It’s always best to request an informational interview in person because you have the opportunity to communicate verbally as well as nonverbally. Although it’s appropriate to send a letter or e-mail to request an informational interview, it’s best to call each person to request the interview or talk to him or her in person. If you use your communication skills, a personal conversation will be much more persuasive than a passive e-mail or letter, which could easily go unanswered.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s03_p02">A telephone conversation should include an introduction along with the reason you are calling. Be clear that you are seeking information; don’t frame your request as a veiled strategy for a job offer. If you are honest about learning about the industry, most people will take the time to help you. You might consider a telephone conversation like this:</p>

That means doing research on the industry, company, and person before you arrive. Visit the company’s Web site as well as those of competitors, research the industry on databases such as Hoovers.com, and do a search on Google to learn more about the person with whom you are interviewing. Also, look her up on LinkedIn, Plaxo.com, Ryze.com, or other professional social networking Web sites to learn more about her professional background before your meeting.</p>

It’s best not to use regular copy paper as it is lightweight and doesn’t provide strong nonverbal communication about your brand. You never know when the person with whom you are meeting will ask for an extra copy of your résumé.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p06">In addition to having your questions ready, also be ready to talk about your brand positioning points (review this concept in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>). Use your communication skills to make your experience and interest come alive in the interview. It’s a good idea to offer to show the samples of your work while you are talking about why you are interested in pursuing a career path in the industry.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p07">Take the time to print out your questions so you are organized during the interview. Put your questions and spare copies of your résumé in a professional portfolio or folder. Don’t be afraid to refer to your questions and take notes during the interview; it’s an excellent nonverbal cue that you think what the interviewer has to say is important.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p08">Wrap up your informational interview by asking for your interviewee’s business card. Also, ask for the names of some other people that you might be able to learn from; for example, “I really enjoyed our conversation today, and I learned so much about the industry. You have helped me realize that I would like to pursue a career in sales. Can you give me the names of some other people I might be able to learn from?”</p>

                <p class="simpara">Keep in Touch</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p09">What about after the informational interview? Keep in touch. People who take the time to help students also want to know what is going on with the young job-seeking population. Send an e-mail or touch base by phone at least every four to six weeks. It’s a great way to develop a relationship and network, even after you land your internship or job. Part of networking is providing exchange, and keeping in touch is your part of the bargain. When you keep in touch, your interviewer might be able to help you in the future; or better yet, you might be able to help her and return the favor.</p>

<em class="emphasis bolditalic">When</em> to Ask for an Informational Interview</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s05_p01">It’s always a good time to meet and learn from experienced people in the industry in which you are interested. However, you should actively pursue informational interviews when you are prepared with your résumé and have compiled some samples of your work. Keep in mind that every contact you make is a selling opportunity for your personal brand so it’s best to be ready as early as possible in your academic career. It’s never too soon to prepare your résumé even as you are building your experience with internships and other jobs. Whenever you meet someone interesting, follow up and ask him for an informational interview so you can learn more about how he got into the business.</p>

<em class="emphasis bolditalic">Where</em> to Have an Informational Interview</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s06_p01">Your interviewee will most likely suggest a location for your meeting; it might be in her office, or you might meet for breakfast or lunch. Some informational interviews might take place by phone. The objective is to connect, learn, and network.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s06_p02">Whatever the location, always prepare and dress for each informational interview as if it were a job interview. Also, always send a thank-you note to thank your interviewer for his time. You should send a thank-you e-mail and a handwritten thank-you note on the same day, so your interviewer will receive your e-mail followed by your handwritten note. That way, you leave a lasting impression and demonstrate your good etiquette.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s06_l01">
                    <li>An <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> is an underused career search method that includes a meeting with a professional to learn more about pursuing a career in a specific industry, profession, or job.</li>
                    <li>You go on <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interviews</strong> to learn what it’s like to work in a particular industry, company or job, connect and network with people in the industry, and hone your interviewing skills.</li>
                    <li>One thing you should <em class="emphasis">never</em> do on an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> is ask for a job or internship. If the opportunity presents itself and your interviewer asks if you might be interested, it’s appropriate to say yes. However, you should not be the one to initiate dialogue about the possibility of a position with the company.</li>
                    <li>You should ask anyone who is in the industry or profession that you would like to pursue. It’s a good idea to use your networking skills to identify people with whom you can have an informational interview. Professionals such as guest speakers in class, prominent executives, and those in local professional organizations are ideal people to ask for an informational interview.</li>
                    <li>It’s best to request an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> in person or by phone because you increase your chances for a positive response. You can also request an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> by letter or e-mail.</li>
                    <li>Prepare for an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> as if it were a job interview, even if you already know the person. Research the company, bring extra copies of your résumé and samples of your work, and prepare questions that you would like to discuss.</li>

He is convinced that your company’s security system is the one he wants to use, but he has to convince his boss. The key selling point in his mind, he mentions to you, is the fact that the system carries a money-back guarantee so that if anything happens, the company will be protected. You realize that he has misinterpreted the terms of the guarantee. It is a money-back guarantee only on the security system itself, not for any other loss. It appears that there was some miscommunication between all the meetings and follow-up e-mails.</p>

            <li>Soft skills include communication, relationship building, emotional intelligence, and the ability to interact with people. Hard skills are the technical skills required to perform your job, such as analytical skills in the finance area.</li>
            <li>The sender is Axe (Clix); Nick Lachey acts as the spokesperson in this commercial. The message is that Clix is such a great scent that it attracts lots of women. The message is encoded in video: a commercial. The receiver is the viewer of the commercial, and the target audience is young men. The decoding occurs when a young man sees that Clix is so good that it can attract more women than Nick Lachey. The sender (Clix) gets feedback in several ways: when people view the video, when people post comments about the video or the product, and when people buy the product.</li>
            <li>Repeat the information that you heard by saying, “Let me be sure I understand what you’re saying…,” nodding your head, and taking notes.</li>
            <li>Verbal communication is best for communicating emotions because you can use or hear intonation. It is also natural and fast and provides instant feedback. However, verbal communication is gone in an instant (unless it’s recorded), and people remember what was said differently. Also, we speak at about 125 words per minute, but listen at about 400 to 500 words per minute, so people’s minds wander during a good amount of verbal communication. Nonverbal communication includes body language and any other type of communication that can be observed. Nonverbal communication can underscore a message, such as hand gestures, or can send a different signal than the spoken words, such as crossed arms or physical proximity. But sometimes people don’t realize the messages they are sending when they use nonverbal communication because it can be more difficult to interpret. Written communication is the most permanent of all communication types. It is usually considered and is used for formal business communication such as policies, pricing, and other information. Written communication lacks intonation and is best used for communicating factual information. Grammar and spelling are critical for written communication to be effective.</li>
            <li>It would be best to call him to let her know. This would allow you the opportunity to demonstrate a high sense of urgency, explain the situation, and discuss possible options. It’s always best to communicate bad news (especially to your boss) verbally, whether in person or by phone.</li>
            <li>You should pay when you invite. Although it is appropriate to let your customer pay for a meal once in a while, it’s usually expected that the salesperson’s company will pick up the tab.</li>
            <li>Whenever someone does something that is worth noting—referring you to a new prospect, hosting a productive meeting, being a great business partner, providing some information that was difficult to get, or any other situation that is worth a thank you—then note it. People rarely send thank-you notes, so it’s an excellent way to set yourself apart. A thank-you e-mail is always appropriate, but a handwritten thank-you note is more personal.</li>
            <li>The only time it is appropriate is if you are waiting for an <em class="emphasis">urgent</em> phone call. If that is the case, you should mention it before the meeting starts, put your cell phone on vibrate, and step out of the meeting to take the call. If you are waiting for a text, only check your device occasionally as to not send the message that the other matter is more important than the meeting you are in.</li>
