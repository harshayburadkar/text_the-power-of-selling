    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_p01">You can see that FAB is a powerful way to build an emotional connection with a customer. It is also an excellent way to stand out to a prospective employer in an interview.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_p02">You’ve already done a lot of work that will serve you well as you network and interview—you’ve identified your brand positioning points in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>, put them to work in your résumé and cover letter in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a>, and developed your elevator pitch in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch05#fwk-125752-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Power of Effective Communication"</a>. All these activities help you bring your personal FAB (feature, advantage, benefit) message into focus. Your FAB message will help you tell the details about your brand and will help you tell your “stories” about your experience and accomplishments during your interviews.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Class projects</strong>. Choose those projects that demonstrate your skills, especially in your major. For example, if you did a sales presentation, include a video clip along with your selling aids. Or if you created a PR plan, include the plan along with the exhibits. Group projects are acceptable as long as the group names are included on the title page. A team project allows you to talk about how you provided leadership to the team or helped the team get focused.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Internship projects</strong>. If you had an internship or multiple internships, include samples of the projects on which you worked. For example, include copies of Web pages, brochures, flyers, graphs, presentations, or other samples of your work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Volunteer projects</strong>. If you have been involved in a student group, community service, or other service organization, include samples of the projects on which you worked. For example, if your group did a fundraiser for breast cancer, include the flyer for the event along with photos and a summary of the contributions.</li>

            <p class="simpara">Keep a Copy</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s02_p04">Whenever you work on a class project, internship, volunteer project, or any other type of project that demonstrates your skills, keep a copy for your portfolio. The same is true when you begin working; keep copies of all your projects to continue to build your portfolio throughout your career. You never know when you will need to show samples of your work. It’s best to avoid including any confidential or proprietary information from companies or organizations.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s02_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other work samples</strong>. If you enjoy photography, writing, design, selling on eBay, or other activity that has application to the position for which you are seeking, include that work. In other words, print the Web page for your eBay store along with the feedback you have received, include photographs or other projects on which you have worked to show your work. If you don’t have samples of your work for your portfolio, consider starting a blog and print copies of your entries.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Letters of recommendation</strong>. Ask for a letter of recommendation from former supervisors, colleagues, team leaders, professors, and other people who will be happy to write a letter about your skills.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_089">Maureen Crawford Hentz, “How to Obtain and Use References and Recommendation Letters,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/references_recommendation_letters.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/references_recommendation_letters.html</a> (accessed August 5, 2009)</span> If you have had a summer job or internship, ask your former boss and other people with whom you worked to write a letter of recommendation. Keep the copies of the letters in your portfolio and show them to prospective employers during your interview. Although these letters are different from references, they serve the purpose of <em class="emphasis">showing</em> your prospective employer how highly people regard you and your work. You will be asked for references after the interview process if you are one of the final candidates. See the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch04#fwk-125752-ch04">Chapter 4 "Business Ethics: The Power of Doing the Right Thing"</a> for more information about how to contact and submit references, including how letter of recommendation from references can help set you apart.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_p01">After you gather all of your work samples, here are a few tips that will help you organize them for an effective visual story.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose a few work samples</strong>. Select samples (no more than five or six) that reflect your brand positioning points. If leadership is important, be sure to include projects, results, pictures, and other visual elements that will demonstrate your leadership story.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create a summary page for each work sample</strong>. Include bullet points for the project name, objective, approach or strategy, and results. A sample is provided in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_f01">Figure 6.13 "Sample Summary Page"</a>. This will help you quickly summarize the key points when you are showing your portfolio.</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use clean copies, in color where appropriate</strong>. Avoid using papers that include comments or grades. Use fresh, clean copies of all samples. If you need to make a copy of an original document that was in color, splurge and pay for color copies; it’s worth it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Include extra copies of your résumé</strong>. Your portfolio is a great place to keep at least three or four extra copies of your most current résumé printed on twenty-four-pound paper. Although your interviewer may have already received your résumé before the interview, he may not have it handy when you come in. Or you may be asked to meet with some people that were not on the original interview schedule. If this is the case, you can be the consummate professional and offer your interviewer a reference copy of your résumé. It’s also the perfect time to mention your portfolio.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use a professional binder or portfolio</strong>. Visit a local or online art supply or office supply store and get a professional three-ring binder or portfolio. You can include your work samples in plastic sleeves, but it is not required. Many portfolios include plastic sleeves for your samples. Ask if the store offers a student discount.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Make It Memorable</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_p02">As you develop your FAB and portfolio, think about the stories you want to tell about each one. Stories are much more powerful than facts. For example, “I can really appreciate what it takes to go the extra mile for a customer. When I worked at J&amp;J Catering, they needed someone to mix the giant vats of cookie dough. Needless to say, I spent hours working with the dough, but I wanted to make it interesting, so I learned how ingredients work together, and I created a new recipe for lemon cookies that became the signature dessert of the company.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s04_p01">A portfolio is a must to bring on a job interview. You might be wondering if it’s a good idea to also create an online portfolio. The answer is “yes.” Creating your own professional Web site as a way to showcase your résumé, samples of your work, awards, and letter of recommendation is a perfect way to build your brand and demonstrate to your prospective employer that you have additional technology skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s04_p02">Your online portfolio, or Web site, should include all the elements that are included in your offline portfolio. Since space is not an issue, you may want to include even more samples of your work, especially if you have writing or design samples. This is also an ideal place to include a link to your blog.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s04_p03">A word of caution: Your professional Web site should be exactly that—professional. That means no personal photos, comments, or casual blog posts from friends. In other words, your Facebook page is not an appropriate place for your professional Web site. Use a business-like domain name (http://www.yourname.com); if you don’t already have one, you can get one at Google or GoDaddy.com, for a minimal annual fee. The following article provides six steps to set up a domain name and your own Web site.</p>

                <li>You can also create an online <strong class="emphasis bold">portfolio</strong> on a professional Web site that includes the same information as your physical <strong class="emphasis bold">portfolio</strong>. Also include your Web site address in the contact information on your résumé and mention it in your cover letter.</li>
                <li>Be ready to introduce and review your <strong class="emphasis bold">portfolio</strong> in an interview; you’ll need to take the initiative as your prospective employer won’t know you have work samples to show.</li>
                <li>Be proud of showing your work samples. Rehearse exactly what you will say about each sample and keep it concise.</li>
