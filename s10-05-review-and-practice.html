Following are two roles that are involved in the same selling situation—one role is the customer, and the other is the salesperson. This will give you the opportunity to think about this selling situation from the point of view of both the customer and the salesperson.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s05_p03">Read each role carefully along with the discussion questions. Then, be prepared to play either of the roles in class using the concepts covered in this chapter. You may be asked to discuss the roles and do a role-play in groups or individually.</p>

            <li>Prospecting and qualifying, preapproach, approach, presentation, handling objections, closing the sale, and follow-up.</li>
            <li>Qualifying helps save time so you don’t waste time calling on people who don’t have the time, money, or authority to purchase your product or service.</li>
            <li>Handling objections.</li>
            <li>False. The salesperson’s job really begins when the sale is closed.</li>
            <li>When prospecting is done correctly, the other steps in the selling process build upon it.</li>
            <li>The sales funnel is a helpful way to visualize the process of finding and qualifying new prospects and ultimately converting them to customers. Not all leads become prospects, and not all prospects become customers.</li>
            <li>A lead is a qualified prospect.</li>
            <li>There are several databases and directories, including Directory of Corporate Affiliations, Hoovers, and D&amp;B Million Dollar Database.</li>
            <li>There are several business journals including <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">Business Journals</em> (by city), <em class="emphasis">Crain</em> (by major city).</li>
            <li>Cold calling gives you an opportunity to talk to the prospect and learn more about his goals and how you can add value.</li>
            <li>Subject matter experts are people who are authorities in their field. Subject matter experts share their knowledge at trade shows, at industry events, on blogs, and in other online communities and social networks. Being a subject matter expert helps establish you as being a leader in a particular area. Prospects usually want to learn more from and do business with subject matter experts.</li>
