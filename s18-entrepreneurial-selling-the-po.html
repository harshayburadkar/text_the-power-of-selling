Although most commercial airlines have been working on policies and procedures to make pets more comfortable when traveling, and give their owners more peace of mind, husband-and-wife team Alysa Binder and Dan Wiesel just didn’t feel that options like Delta’s Pet First and Continental’s PetSafe really filled the bill. So on July 14, 2009, they launched Pet Airways, the first airline dedicated exclusively to transporting animals in a safe and comfortable environment. The airline includes nineteen turboprop Beech 1900 planes that have been converted to comfortably carry up to fifty live animal crates and one certified pet attendant.

The Kauffman Foundation, in conjunction with researchers from Babson College and the London School of Business, found that the disparity in entrepreneurial activity in some countries is contributing to a gap in economic growth. “The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report provides conclusive evidence that promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the entrepreneurial dynamic of a country should be an integral element of any government’s commitment to boosting economic well-being,” according to Paul Reynolds, GEM project coordinator at both Babson College and the London Business School.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_020">Small Business, “Entrepreneurs Add Vitality to the Economy,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html">http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html</a> (accessed September 19, 2009).</span> According to the study, Canada, Israel, and the United States are those countries that are experiencing the highest level of activity, while Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, and Japan have the lowest levels of activity. The GEM constructed a framework for countries to work within to encourage entrepreneurial activity that includes raising the participation level to those outside the core age group of twenty-five to forty-four and increasing the participation of women in the entrepreneurial process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_021">Small Business, “Entrepreneurs Add Vitality to the Economy,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html">http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html</a> (accessed September 19, 2009).</span></p>

In 2008, approximately 530,000 new businesses were created every month, which was a slight increase over 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_024">Laura Petrecca, “Tough Times Drive Start-Ups,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, September 14, 2009, B2.</span></p>

Entrepreneurialism isn’t limited to a specific type of organization or business; it’s a state of mind, a way of thinking and behaving, a way of pushing for something better than the status quo. Entrepreneurs can be found in large multinational corporations as well as nonprofit organizations, and new business start-ups. Every large business or organization had to start small but think differently.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s01_s03_p03">Where does it all start? The entrepreneurial drive starts early for most who have it. Think about when you were young. If you were the one in the neighborhood who set up a lemonade stand, went door-to-door selling products, or set up a lawn-mowing service in the neighborhood (and hired your friends), you may have the makings of an entrepreneur. While you and many of your friends (and perhaps your siblings) participated in activities like this when you were young, not everyone will grow up to be an entrepreneur. A recent study, which focused on the behaviors of identical twins, has found evidence that entrepreneurialism may be based on genetics, not environment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_026">Nicos Nicolaou, Scott Shane, Lyn Cherkas, Janice Hunkin, and Tim D.

Ali Galgano recently traded in her high-powered job as corporate recruiter doing work for firms such as Goldman Sachs for her own jewelry company, Charm &amp; Chain.

The thrill of running your own show and making your dream come alive is a learning process. There are no bosses, no corporate initiatives, no departmental deadlines, and no performance reviews. Everything is all you, all the time. Skills such as time management, understanding financial statements, building a good support system, and overcoming the isolation of working alone are all challenges in the entrepreneurial world. “Entrepreneurs have to be willing to listen and learn and make judgments and be adaptive,” according to Monica Doss, director of the Kauffman Foundation’s FastTrac entrepreneur training programs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_032">Laura Petrecca, “From Corporation to Start-up: Who Is Going to Fix the Printer?” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, September 21, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/startup/week2-corporation-to-startup.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/startup/week2-corporation-to-startup.htm</a> (accessed September 21, 2009).</span> As for the issue of timing, some ideas might not work in the current economic environment.

It’s more than “riches” according to Scott Laughlin, director of the University of Maryland’s Tech Entrepreneurship Program. Entrepreneurs are more interested in “wealth”; he points to two of the most famous entrepreneurs, Bill Gates from Microsoft and Warren Buffet from Berkshire Hathaway, who have pooled their resources into the $60 billion philanthropy called the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. “Wealth is broader, encompassing less tangible rewards such as respect and independence,” says Laughlin.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_048">Jim Hopkins, “Starting a Business: What It Takes,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, October 25, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smAllBusiness/2006-07-30-starting-your-business_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/smAllBusiness/2006-07-30-starting-your-business_x.htm</a> (accessed September 19, 2009).</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s02_p02">Being an entrepreneur in some ways is like being a student: you have to do your homework. In the business setting, that means creating a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business plan</a><span class="glossdef">A document that details everything about the business from the product position in the marketplace to the financial information for the next three years.</span></span>: a road map of the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your business. A business plan is a document that details everything about the business from the product position in the marketplace to the financial information for the next three years. But a business plan is not simply like a term paper—a project that’s completed and then put on the shelf. A business plan is a dynamic document and should serve four purposes:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s02_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sell you on the business</strong>. While this might sound like a no-brainer, the business plan development process includes rigorous research that can be a good eye-opener about the feasibility of your idea. Ideally, your business plan helps put your idea and its potential into perspective and gives you the details you need to move from concept to reality. However, even if you determine that your idea doesn’t have as much potential as you thought or might cost more than you anticipated, the process of creating a business plan helped you reach that conclusion.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sell others on the business</strong>. In many cases, a business needs some kind of support—financial, consultative, or other resources. In this case, the business plan plays the role of the selling and marketing materials for your idea. How you make your idea come alive and support it with the necessary research and financial data can be the difference between someone becoming a stakeholder in your new venture or taking a pass.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Give you confidence</strong>. Having a great idea is one thing, doing the research to understand exactly what it will take to make the idea real is quite another. Having a better understanding of what it takes to launch and manage the business puts you in control to solicit investors and other supporters and start your journey.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Improve your chances of success</strong>. A business plan is a lot of planning and work, but it’s worth it. According to a study conducted by AT&amp;T, 42 percent of entrepreneurs who had written a business plan rated themselves as more successful than the 58 percent who hadn’t written one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_049">David E.

Although you have worked for hours (probably months, if not years) on your business plan, your presentation or pitch should focus on the key points and demonstrate not only that it is a potentially profitable business idea (or nonprofit organization that can achieve its goals) but also that you are the right person to make the concept come alive.</p>
