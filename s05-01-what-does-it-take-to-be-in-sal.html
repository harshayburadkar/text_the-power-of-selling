    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_p01">When Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, delivered the commencement address at Stanford University in 2005, he told the story of how he and Steve Wozniak started the now $32 billion company in a garage in 1976. Jobs said, “I was lucky—I found out what I wanted to do early in life.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_001">Steve Jobs, “You’ve Got to Find What You Love,” commencement address at Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, June 12, 2005, in <em class="emphasis">Stanford Report</em>, June 14, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html</a> (accessed June 16, 2009).</span> But life at Apple wasn’t always so perfect. When he was thirty, just one year after the launch of the Macintosh, he was fired from the company he founded. Although he was publicly humiliated and frustrated and didn’t know what to do next, he realized that he indeed loved what he did. From there he went on to start Pixar, the company that created <em class="emphasis">Toy Story</em>, the world’s first full-length computer-animated feature film.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_p02">He left the Stanford graduates with some personal words of wisdom to think about as they prepared themselves for their careers: “Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep looking. Don’t settle. As with all matters of the heart, you’ll know when you find it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_002">Steve Jobs, “You’ve Got to Find What You Love,” commencement address at Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, June 12, 2005, in <em class="emphasis">Stanford Report</em>, June 14, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html">http://news.stanford.edu/news/2005/june15/jobs-061505.html</a> (accessed June 16, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_p03">To be successful in sales, and in life, you must love what you do. If you aren’t passionate about your profession, you will never be the best. You will always fall short because the people who love it will naturally excel. It seems simple enough: do what you love. But what if you love many things or don’t know if you’ve found your niche? Don’t worry—there are questions you can ask yourself to help you determine whether a career in sales will excite you and make you want to leap out of bed every morning.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Are You Born to Sell?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_p01">How do you know if sales is your passion, the career of your dreams? The first step is taking this course. You’ll have an opportunity to learn about sales and actually put your knowledge to work in real-life situations by role-playing with your classmates. After reading this chapter, you will better understand the profession of selling and what it has to offer. This chapter includes insights about which personal characteristics and talents are best suited to sales, which industries you might work in, and how you can be successful in the profession.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_p02">Just like being a teacher requires traits such as a love of learning, an ability to communicate, and the talent to make concepts come alive for people, selling calls for certain personal characteristics as well. Some people think that successful salespeople are those who have the “gift of gab,” but that’s not really what makes salespeople effective. Although communication and relationship building are valuable skills, just being able to talk to people is not enough to be successful in sales. Consider the following points that make a salesperson successful and see if these are a good match to you and your skills.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s01_p01">It never goes without saying that character—the combination of your beliefs, tendencies, and actions that you take—is the single defining trait for a salesperson (or any business person, for that matter).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_003">Dave Kahle, “The Four Characteristics of Successful Salespeople,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Distribution</em> 97, no. 4 (April 2008): 54.</span> Your character defines how you will conduct yourself, and it is the yardstick by which customers measure you. After all, your customers are spending their money based on what you say you will deliver; they have to trust you. If you ever break the trust for any reason, you will likely lose not only the sale, but you will most likely lose your reputation, and, ultimately, your livelihood. According to a survey by Forrester Research, trust and believability are so important in the buying and selling processes that 71 percent of buyers based their decisions on these traits.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_004">Robert W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p01">The most successful salespeople know how to engage their customers in a way that helps the customers identify for themselves the way the product or service offered can deliver value. The Xerox Company, after conducting a survey to identify the characteristics of their peak-performing salespeople, says it best: “Your prospect will never buy because you present a pitch. She instead buys from what she convinces herself of. This means that if you are selling a watch, telling your prospect you will cure his ignorance of time will not be enough. Your prospect will literally talk to himself to discover that this watch will indeed keep him from running late. He will not listen to you; he will only listen to himself.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_005">Kerry Johnson, “Five Characteristics of Peak Sales Performers,” Event Solution International, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.eventsolution.com/education/businessarticles.html">http://www.eventsolution.com/education/businessarticles.html</a> (accessed June 16, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s02_p04">A good salesperson will use his personal skills to connect with a customer, so that their conversation prompts and echoes the customer’s own internal thought process. It is ultimately this ability to connect that allows the salesperson to build relationships and trust. This video highlights how a motorcycle trip, passion, and connecting led to a sale with Harley-Davidson.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s03_p01">Contrary to popular belief, speaking is not the most important aspect of selling—listening is, because “salespeople are communicators, not manipulators.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_006">Monroe Porter, “Six Common Characteristics of Successful Salespeople,” <em class="emphasis">Pro</em> 20, no. 6 (May 2008): 33.</span> It’s interesting to note that many of the salespeople who are constantly talking are actually not successful. It is those salespeople who have a genuine interest in listening who learn precisely what the customers’ needs, priorities, and opportunities are. Listening skills are the fundamental basis for forming a connection. “Listening builds relationships,” according to Marjorie Brody, author of <em class="emphasis">Help! Was That a Career-Limiting Move?</em> She suggests a “silent solution” to many problems in the form of listening.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_007">Pamela J. Holland and Marjorie Brody, <em class="emphasis">Help! Was That a Career-Limiting Move?</em> (Jenkintown, PA: Career Skills Press, 2005).</span> The challenge for many people is that listening with undivided attention is hard to do. According to Barry J. Elms, CEO of Strategic Negotiations International, psychologists say that we listen using only 25 percent of our brain.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_008">Steve Atlas, “Listening for Buying Signals: Missing Your Prospects’ Buying Signals,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 20, no. 2, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5350">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5350</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> That means that the other 75 percent is thinking about a response or thinking about something else. Salespeople who take notes, refer to written material, and are intently aware of their nonverbal cues can be extremely successful because they see and hear things that people who are talking just can’t absorb.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_009">Steve Atlas, “Listening for Buying Signals: Missing Your Prospects’ Buying Signals,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>20, no. 2, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5350">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5350</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> See why Andy Taylor, CEO of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, thinks great listening skills make a great salesperson.</p>

Those questions can only be asked when you listen and have the ability to connect. Paul Blake, whom you met at the beginning of this chapter, believes that asking the right questions is vital to the success of his sales force. That’s why he leads by example and always asks one key question when he is interviewing candidates for sales positions: “Do you believe you have the right to change someone’s opinion?” That single question tells him all he needs to know about the candidate and how she would perform on his sales team.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_011">Paul Blake, interview with the author, Greater Media Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, December 11, 2009.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s05_p01">You might think that just because you are in school, you are learning everything you need to know for your career. Although you are building a strong foundation, you will continue to learn new things every day when you are working. Salespeople must not only have product knowledge and understand the buying and selling process; they must also learn skills that will make them more effective and efficient as salespeople. For example, in one study on salespeople, executives mentioned that salespeople must be willing to learn more than what appears to be required. Financial skills, negotiating skills, and even speed-reading courses were mentioned as additional training needs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_012">John F. Tanner, Jr., Christophe Fournier, Jorge A. Wise, Sandrine Hollet, and Juliet Poujol, “Executives’ Perspectives of the Changing Role of the Sales Profession: View from France, the United States, and Mexico,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing</em> 23, no. 3 (2008): 193.</span> It’s important to note that besides constantly learning new skills, salespeople have to be students of the business. Skills and abilities are developed and fine-tuned over time, and experience plays a role in the learning process. So it stands to reason that salespeople are not “made” simply because they have the title. Just as it takes seven years to become a doctor, three years to become a lawyer, and a thousand hours to become a barber, a great salesperson develops over time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_013">Margaret Norton, “Is the Successful Salesperson Made or Born?” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Is-the-Successful-Sales-Person-Made-Or-Born?&amp;#38;id=1020044">http://ezinearticles.com/?Is-the-Successful-Sales-Person-Made-Or-Born?&amp;#38;id=1020044</a> (accessed June 16, 2009).</span> If you’re thinking about pursuing a career in sales, keep in mind that like other professions it takes time, training, and experience to be successful.</p>

Great salespeople set goals for themselves, achieve them, and celebrate those achievements. They visualize what they want, then put together a plan to get it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_014">Kelley Robertson, “10 Characteristics of Successful Salespeople,” Business Know-How, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/successful-salesperson.htm">http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/successful-salesperson.htm</a> (accessed June 16, 2009).</span> The drive to succeed is important not only in sales, but also in life. Consider Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps. He set out to do something that no one else had ever done: win eight Olympic gold medals. It’s instructive to look at his drive to succeed and what he did to prepare for and achieve his goals. While Phelps has had some recent public relations (PR) challenges about his behavior out of the pool, it doesn’t diminish his hard work, drive to succeed, and accomplishments.</p>

You can only succeed when you go the extra mile, by investigating one more lead, going back for the second sales call even when the first hasn’t been successful, and trial closing even if you are not sure you can really get the sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_016">Dave Kahle, “The Four Characteristics of Successful Salespeople,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Distribution</em> 97, no. 4 (April 2008): 54.</span> It’s the eternal optimism that pushes you, even when others might think there is no reason to pursue the sale.

You can set yourself apart by taking smart business risks. Think about how you consider taking risks in everyday life and how they pay off. For example, let’s say you are from a small town and you chose to go to a college in a big city because you wanted to experience something new. That was a risk; it took you outside your comfort zone. But if you hadn’t taken the risk, you would have never known what life in a big city was like. Great salespeople go beyond the norm to explore and test the waters. For example, making phone calls to senior executives that you have never met, networking with people you don’t know, or making a presentation to a room full of customers all involve some level of risk. But getting out of your comfort zone and taking risks is how great opportunities are found.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_017">Dave Kahle, “Characteristics of a Successful Professional—A Propensity to Take Risks,” <em class="emphasis">Agency Sales</em> 36, no. 6 (June 2006): 40.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s09_p01">It may sound intuitive that successful salespeople shouldn’t be afraid to ask for a customer’s order, but you would be surprised at how often it happens. Most customers <em class="emphasis">want</em> you to ask for their order. “Would you like fries with your hamburger?” “What can I get you for dessert?” and “Would you like to pay with credit or debit?” are all examples of salespeople asking for the order.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s09_p03">A large percentage of the time these salespeople are successful and meet their customers’ needs at the same time.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s10_p01">Most sales positions require independence, self-motivation, and discipline. Although these traits may seem contradictory, they are actually complementary. Independence is especially important if you are calling on customers in person. It usually requires travel, either locally by car or by plane, which means that you have to be able to manage your time without being told what to do. In fact, it means that you set your schedule and do what you need to do to meet your sales goals. But having this kind of independence requires discipline. As Michael Janusz, an account manager at ACL Laboratories put it, “I went into sales because of the dynamic environment, competitive aspect, and income potential. I do think there is a shortage of good salespeople. I think this is because it takes a unique blend of skills and a disciplined person. There are many people who can talk well, manage a territory well, or work hard. However, not many can put it all together.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_021">“What Do Salespeople Want?” <em class="emphasis">BizTimes</em>, March 30, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.biztimes.com/news/2007/3/30/what-do-salespeople-want">http://www.biztimes.com/news/2007/3/30/what-do-salespeople-want</a> (accessed June 19, 2009).</span> Besides having an independent streak, salespeople must be focused and hardworking in the long term, or they will not enjoy consistent success over time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s11_p01">Along with the need for independence comes the importance of flexibility. Just as you are able to set your own schedule, you have to be flexible based on your customers’ needs. Most sales positions are not nine-to-five jobs. That means you might be working nights or weekends, or you might be traveling out of town during the week or even long periods of time, especially if you are selling internationally. You have to be available when your customers want to buy. Before you cringe at the prospect of grueling hours and long flights, remember that this kind of schedule may also work to your advantage. You may have some weekdays off, which allow you to enjoy family, sports, or other outings that you might not otherwise have an opportunity to enjoy.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s12_p01">If you’re not passionate about what you’re selling, how do you expect your customers to believe in you and your product? You have to love what you do, believe in it, and feel passionately about it. Passion encompasses all the traits mentioned above; it’s how they all come together. Passion is the element that sets you apart from other salespeople and makes your prospects and customers believe in you and your product or service. See why Selena Cuff, head of Heritage Link Brands, thinks passion is what makes a great salesperson.</p>

Every profession requires a lot of those who pursue it. To make it easier, you may want to think about how these traits come together. Mahan Khalsa, founder of FranklinCovey Sales Performance Group and author of <em class="emphasis">Let’s Get Real or Let’s Not Play: The Demise of Dysfunctional Selling and the Advent of Helping Clients Succeed</em>, sums up the traits of a successful salesperson this way: “There are three traits that define a successful salesperson: business intelligence (IQ or intelligence quotient), the ability to create rapport and build trust (EQ or emotional intelligence), and a good way to approach and to follow up sales (XQ or executional intelligence; the ability to execute the sale).”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_022">Mike McCue, “Lessons from the Master,” <em class="emphasis">Sales and Marketing Management</em>, March 1, 2008, 22–24.</span></p>

                <p class="simpara">It’s All about <em class="emphasis">Their</em> Stuff</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s01_s13_p05">Mark Bozzini, CEO of Infinite Spirits, learned a powerful selling lesson early in his career. His job was to sell more bottles of wine than were sold the previous year, which seemed easy enough. But when he called on a wine and spirits retailer, the storeowner told him that his products didn’t sell and he would rather not have them on his shelves. So much for selling more bottles of wine. An average salesperson might become pushy, or even leave and seek a sale elsewhere. But Bozzini, an intuitive and passionate salesman, was determined to make the sale. He spent an hour rearranging the store display and asked the storeowner to give it a chance to see if the product sold better. The new display worked, and the storeowner became one of Bozzini’s best customers. The moral of the story: always remember that “the customer doesn’t care about your stuff. They care about <em class="emphasis">their</em> stuff.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_023">Anna Muoio, “Sales School,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/one.html?page=0%2C2">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/one.html?page=0%2C2</a> (accessed June 23, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s02_p01">The role of a salesperson can be summed up in one sentence: “Salespeople are value creators.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_024">John F. Tanner, Jr., Christophe Fournier, Jorge A. Wise, Sandrine Hollet, and Juliet Poujol, “Executives’ Perspectives of the Changing Role of the Sales Profession: View from France, the United States, and Mexico,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business and Industrial Marketing</em> 23, no. 3 (2008): 193.</span> To further describe what this means, think about a recent visit to the Apple Store. If you go to the store at virtually any hour, it is filled with customers. The salespeople are not just those that are pushing a product, hoping that you buy so that they make their sales quota. They are experts who know everything about the products in the store whether they be MacBooks, iPods, or iPhones. The salespeople engage you in dialogue, listen, and learn about what you are looking for. They ask questions like, “What do you do with the photos you take? Do you like to make videos? Do you want to easily access the Web from your phone?” No techno-talk, no slick sales pitches. They just want to know what’s important to you so that they can let you try the product that not only fits your basic computing needs, but blows you away.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s01_s02_p02">Apple and its sales team know that computers are complicated and can baffle even savvy users. To build trust and confidence with their customers, they developed the “Genius Bar” so that Apple users know that they can always to talk to an individual and find help with any problem or question they may have. In fact, Apple dedicates a section of their Web site to the Genius Bar and invites customers to make an appointment online to come to a store to talk to one of the “resident Geniuses.” Talk about creating value. As a result, Apple is able to charge a premium for its product and generate such demand that in some cases people are lined up to buy their products, as was the case for the launch of the iPhone 3GS in June 2009.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_025">Brandon Griggs, “iPhone 3GS Launch Has App Developers Seeing Gold,” <em class="emphasis">CNN.com</em>, June 19, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/06/19/iphone.3gs.launch">http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/06/19/iphone.3gs.launch</a> (accessed June 26, 2009).</span></p>

You might talk to customers via phone, live chat, instant message, and text, or you might meet with them in their office in your neighborhood, your region, or anywhere around the world. You might be working on research to identify new customers, preparing a presentation for a new or existing customer, meeting with customers face-to-face, following up to get contracts signed, or communicating inside your organization to be sure all goes well to deliver the product or service to the customer on time and on budget.

Michael Dell started by selling computers from his dorm room.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_026">Anna Muoio, “Sales School,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/one.html?page=0%2C3">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/one.html?page=0%2C3</a> (accessed June 23, 2009).</span> Selling could eventually give you fame and fortune, but more immediately it can also give you the satisfaction of providing solutions to people, financial opportunity, and even financial independence.

Your income is commensurate with the amount of sales you generate; simply put, you can make as much money as you want. This is a major difference between sales and most other disciplines. In most sales positions, you earn a salary and perhaps some other elements of compensation, such as a bonus. In sales, you can determine your income because it is usually not limited to a specific number; it is based on the amount you sell. Although this topic is covered in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch14#fwk-125752-ch14">Chapter 14 "The Power of Learning the Ropes"</a>, it’s worth noting here that you have the power to determine how much you want to earn when you have a successful career in sales.</p>

                    <li>To be successful in sales and in life, you have to enjoy what you do for a living.</li>
                    <li>A good salesperson does more than sell; he builds a relationship and trust with the customer and offers solutions.</li>
                    <li>A successful salesperson is a good listener. It’s important to listen and understand the challenges that the customer is facing in order to present solutions that will work.</li>
                    <li>Asking the right questions is critical to being successful in sales. It is the right questions that provide an opportunity for customers to share their challenges. Successful salespeople are always learning new things from selling techniques to technology in order to bring the best ideas to customers.</li>
                    <li>Selling requires independence and discipline. There is no typical day in selling so salespeople have to be able to manage their own time.</li>
                    <li>One of the biggest challenges of being in sales is the number of times you hear “no.” Successful salespeople are resilient, have a positive attitude, and are willing to take risks.</li>
                    <li>Passion is one of the most important characteristics of a successful salesperson. If a salesperson isn’t passionate about what he sells, it’s unlikely that his customers will be motivated to buy.</li>
                    <li>The primary role of a salesperson is to create value for the customer and the company.</li>
                    <li>A job in sales can be very rewarding on both a personal and a financial level, and it can lead to just about any career path you choose.</li>
