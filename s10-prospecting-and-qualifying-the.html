        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_p01">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>, the sales process is adaptive, which means that each situation may be different and salespeople have to adapt and understand what is important to each customer and where each is in the buying process. But in order for a salesperson to use adaptive selling, he or she must thoroughly understand the steps in the selling process and how each works to can use them effectively.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Evolving Role of Technology in the Selling Process</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p01">While the basics of the selling process have remained the same over the years, the methods of communication and the way people interact are quickly evolving with the use of the interactive capabilities on the Internet by customers and salespeople alike. Each step now includes much more collaboration between customers and salespeople (and even between customers) with the use of social networking, consumer reviews, wikis, and other community-based tools. This technology allows salespeople to learn more about their customers at each step, and therefore provide more relevant and powerful solutions to customers at each stage of the buying process (covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch06#fwk-125752-ch06">Chapter 6 "Why and How People Buy: The Power of Understanding the Customer"</a>).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_004">Selling Power Sales 2.0 Newsletter, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, September 18, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=868">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=868</a> (accessed June 21, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p01">Let’s say you want to buy a gym membership. Maybe you received a promotional offer in the mail, your friends on Facebook have had good things to say about a particular gym, or you picked this club because it’s close to home. Whatever the reason, you wander in and ask to speak to the membership director who seems to know a lot about the club and what you might be looking for. After some small talk about the fact that you both live in the same apartment complex, he tells you about the gym’s amenities and gives you a tour of the facility. Then, you sit down to discuss pricing options and payment plans. If you have any questions or concerns (i.e., “I noticed there are only three tennis courts. Is there usually a long wait to use one?” or “Why aren’t there any kickboxing classes on your class schedule?”), the membership director will attempt to address those. Maybe he will tell you there is occasionally a wait to use the tennis courts at peak times, but you can reserve a spot up to a week in advance, in which case you can get right in. Or maybe he’ll say that while they don’t have kickboxing classes, they offer Zumba, which is a fun aerobic alternative.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p02">If you’re satisfied with his responses, and the price and product meet your needs, you will probably decide to sign a contract. Once you’ve signed, someone from the club will probably follow up with a call in a few weeks to see if you’re satisfied with your experience at their gym, or you may get an e-mail from them with a membership satisfaction survey or a text message about an upcoming event.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p03">The example above is an actual selling situation. Although you may not have realized it while you were reading it, the situation follows the seven-step selling process.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s02_p04">Whether you’re buying a gym membership or a car, cell phone service or a new computer, the situation may be different, but the steps in the selling process will follow the same pattern.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p01">The process isn’t only limited to business-to-consumer sales; it’s also the process that IBM will use to sell servers to a corporation, that Accenture will use to sell consulting services to a technology company, or that the Coffee Brewers Company will use to sell espresso machines to coffee shops. Imagine you run a chic new restaurant. You get a call from a salesperson who compliments you on the roasted chicken she had at your restaurant last weekend. After some conversation, she asks if you’re satisfied with your commercial ovens. You have been having some problems with them and have been doing some casual research online. You know that her company is rated as one of the best oven manufacturers, so you tell her: the ovens are over ten years old, they take a long time to heat up, and they sometimes cook things unevenly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p02">“Many older ovens have this problem,” she says. “Would you be interested in learning about the state-of-the-art commercial ovens our company sells?”</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p03">Since you need a solution for your current ovens, you agree to set up an appointment with the salesperson. When the she arrives, you are impressed that she knows so much about your business. She visited your restaurant, reviewed your menu, spoke with some of the wait staff, read reviews on the city magazine Web site, and even had some conversations with some of your patrons on Chef’s Blog. She explains that the ovens she sells heat up quickly and use energy more efficiently. She gives you an estimate of your annual savings on energy costs if you switched over to her product line.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p04">You’re interested, but you’re concerned that the ovens might not cook food evenly. Ovens are a big expense—what happens if you aren’t satisfied with the product? The salesperson says you can lease an oven for a trial period at no obligation, and she shows you reviews from other customers on her company’s Web site and on some restaurant industry blogs. You feel like this might help you solve your problem, so you agree to lease the machine for four months.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p05">After two months, the salesperson calls to ask if you’ve been satisfied with the product so far, and she offers you a discount if you sign a contract to purchase two ovens in the next ten days. Since you have been happy with the leased oven and checked out the company’s service record online from other current customers, you make the purchase.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s01_s03_p06">As in the gym membership example above, this B2B selling situation follows the seven-step framework. Now, take a minute to review this selling situation in the box below to see exactly how the steps are implemented.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Seven Steps of Selling</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s02_p01">Compare the B2B and B2C examples you just read about. Do you notice a pattern? Although the products and customers were quite different, both salespeople adapted to the situation and the customer’s needs, but followed the same seven steps to successfully complete their sales. In fact, you’ve probably used a version of these seven steps yourself before without even realizing it. Take a look at some real-world selling examples below and how of each of the steps is used.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Prospecting and Qualifying</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p01">Before planning a sale, a salesperson conducts research to identify the people or companies that might be interested in her product. In the B2B example, before the salesperson called the company, she had to find the company’s information somewhere—probably in a local business directory. This step is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prospecting</a><span class="glossdef">Identifying potential buyers for a product or service.</span></span>, and it’s the foundational step for the rest of the sales process. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lead</a><span class="glossdef">A potential buyer for a product or service that has not yet been qualified.</span></span> is a potential buyer. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">prospect</a><span class="glossdef">A potential buyer for a product or service; also referred to as a qualified lead.</span></span> is a lead that is qualified or determined to be ready, willing, and able to buy. The prospecting and qualifying step relates to the needs awareness step in the buying process described in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch06#fwk-125752-ch06">Chapter 6 "Why and How People Buy: The Power of Understanding the Customer"</a>. In other words, in a perfect world, you are identifying customers who are in the process of or have already identified a need.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p02">Undoubtedly, when the salesperson called the target customer to discuss his ovens (in the example, you were the customer), she asked some questions to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">qualify</a><span class="glossdef">Determining whether a lead has the desire and ability to buy your product or service.</span></span> him as a prospect, or determine whether he has the desire and ability to buy the product or service. This is the other component to step one. What happens if the customer is not interested in the salesperson’s product, or he’s interested but his business is struggling financially and doesn’t have the resources for a big purchase? Perhaps he is only an employee, not the manager, and he doesn’t have the authority to make the purchasing decision. In this case, he is no longer a prospect, and the salesperson will move on to another lead. Salespeople qualify their prospects so they can focus their sales efforts on the people who are most likely to buy. After all, spending an hour discussing the capabilities of your company’s ovens with a lead that is about to go out of business would be a waste of time. It’s much more fruitful to invest your time with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">qualified prospect</a><span class="glossdef">A prospect a salesperson has determined has the desire and ability to buy the product or service.</span></span>, one who has the desire or ability to buy the product or service.</p>

A good salesperson researches his prospect, familiarizing himself with the customer’s needs and learning all the relevant background info he can about the individual or business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_005">Geoffrey James, “6 Things to Know about Every Prospect,” BNET, January 12, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=705">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=705</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span> Remember that in the B2B example, the salesperson knew important information about the restaurant beforehand.

Bosworth, <em class="emphasis">Solution Selling: Creating Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995), 106.</span> If you’ve ever asked someone on a first date (yes, this is a selling situation), chances are you didn’t call the person and start the conversation off with the question, “Hey, do you want to go out on Saturday night?” Such an abrupt method would turn most people away, and you probably would not score the date you were hoping for. Similarly, as a professional salesperson, you would almost never make a pitch right away; instead, you’d work to establish a rapport with the customer first. This usually involves introductions, making some small talk, asking a few warm-up questions, and generally explaining who you are and whom you represent.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_007">Paul Cherry, <em class="emphasis">Questions That Sell: The Powerful Process of Discovering What Your Customer Really Wants</em> (New York: AMACOM, 2006), 21.</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_008">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">The SPIN Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 40.</span> This is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">approach</a><span class="glossdef">The first few minutes of a sales call, during which the salesperson explains her purpose for coming and establishes a rapport.</span></span>.</p>

By the time she presents her product, she will understand her customer’s needs well enough to be sure she’s offering a solution the customer could use. If you’re a real estate agent selling a house and your customers are an older, retired couple, you won’t take them to see a house with many bedrooms, several flights of stairs to climb, and a huge yard to keep up—nor will you show them around a trendy loft in a busy part of town. The presentation should be tailored to the customer, explaining how the product meets that person or company’s needs. It might involve a tour (as in this real estate example), a product demonstration, videos, PowerPoint presentations, or letting the customer actually look at or interact with the product. At this point, the customer is using the information that is being shared as part of his evaluation of possible solutions.</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s01_s02_s07_l01">
                    <li>The <strong class="emphasis bold">seven-step selling process</strong> refers to the sequence of steps salespeople follow each time they make a sale. The process gives you the power to successfully sell almost anything.</li>
                    <li>The first step of the selling process, <strong class="emphasis bold">prospecting</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">qualifying</strong>, involves searching for potential customers and deciding whether they have the ability and desire to make a purchase. The people and organizations that meet these criteria are <strong class="emphasis bold">qualified prospects</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Before making a sales call, it is important to “do your homework” by researching your customer and planning what you are going to say; this is the <strong class="emphasis bold">preapproach</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The <strong class="emphasis bold">approach</strong> is your chance to make a first impression by introducing yourself, explaining the purpose of your call or visit, and establishing a rapport with your prospect.</li>
                    <li>Your research and preparation pays off during the <strong class="emphasis bold">presentation</strong>, when you propose your sales solution to your prospect.</li>
                    <li>Your prospect will naturally have <strong class="emphasis bold">objections</strong>, which you should look at as opportunities to better understand and respond to his or her needs.</li>
                    <li>Once you overcome objections, you <strong class="emphasis bold">close</strong> the sale by agreeing on the terms and finalizing the transaction.</li>
                    <li>The sales process doesn’t end with the close; <strong class="emphasis bold">follow-up</strong> (i.e., ensuring customer satisfaction and working out the logistics of delivery, installation, and timelines) is essential to retaining existing customers and finding new ones.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_p01">Imagine you decide to build a house from the ground up. After designing your ideal house, of course it would be nice if you could snap your fingers and get to the fun part: watching the finishing touches come together. But before the walls go up you have to make detailed plans and measurements, find your materials and negotiate with contractors, and lay the foundation. All these things require patience, time, and effort, but these steps are absolutely necessary for the project to move forward.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_p02">Planning and laying a foundation is a little like prospecting and qualifying. Finding leads (or people who <em class="emphasis">might</em> be prospects) is the most vital part of the selling process—you can’t make a sale without identifying the people to whom you’ll be selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_014">Charles M. Futrell, <em class="emphasis">The ABC’s of Relationship Selling</em>, 9th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2005).</span> In other words, without prospecting, nothing else can happen. Yet, unlike laying a foundation, prospecting doesn’t happen just once; it’s a constant process. Businesses lose some customers every year for a variety of reasons: customers may no longer need the product or service, have the financial means to purchase the product or service, or live or do business in the area, or the business may no longer be open. So if you haven’t been building your prospect list, you won’t have new customers to replace the ones you lose. More than this, finding new prospects is the only way you can increase your sales and expand your business.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Value of a Lead</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s01_p01">Think of the last time you went to the store to make a major purchase and you started by browsing the products. A salesperson probably approached you with the standard “Can I help you?” and you may have responded with the equally standard “No, thanks. I’m just looking.” Chances are good that the salesperson left you alone after that, very likely assuming you weren’t genuinely interested in making a purchase. Most people—salespeople and customers alike—are surprised to learn that over two-thirds of shoppers who give the “just looking” response end up purchasing the product within a week.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_015">Channel Intelligence, “2004 Channel Intelligence Consumer Buying Intent Survey Reveals Online Shopping Trends,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://channelintelligence.vnewscenter.com/press.do?step=pkview&amp;contentId=1184050872399&amp;companyId=1123580114932">http://channelintelligence.vnewscenter.com/press.do?step=pkview&amp;contentId=1184050872399&amp;companyId=1123580114932</a> (accessed June 10, 2009).</span> In other words, these customers are valuable leads, and all too often their business goes to a competitor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s01_p02">Let’s say you are planning to buy a new refrigerator. That’s generally not the kind of purchase you make on the spot; you will probably go to a number of stores to compare products and prices first. If you tell the salesperson at the second store that you’re just looking, you may then go to a third store and decide you’re ready to buy. As a customer, if the vendors seem more or less equal, you will base your purchasing decision on price, product features, convenience, or a combination of these things. But imagine the salesperson at the second store who took the time to determine your specific needs, wrote down your contact information, and followed up with you. It’s very likely she would make a sale. Her products might be quite similar to her competitors’, but if she goes out of her way to provide you with a solution, you have a reason to buy from her over someone else.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s01_p03">Now let’s change hats. What does knowing this information mean for you as a salesperson? Most importantly, it means that you should never write off a lead until you are <em class="emphasis">certain</em> he can’t be qualified as a prospect. If you work in a showroom that sells only high-end cars like Lexus or BMW and a potential customer walks in wearing torn jeans and a T-shirt, you might be tempted to mentally disqualify him, assuming he won’t have the money to buy such expensive cars. But appearances are often misleading, and you won’t know whether or not your lead is <em class="emphasis">actually</em> qualified until you ask some specific, qualifying questions. When you realize that a lead is the only thing you can turn into a sale, you also realize just how valuable every lead is.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s01_p04">This is true for both B2C <em class="emphasis">and</em> B2B sales, wherein 30 percent to 50 percent of companies that see and respond to business-specific ads end up purchasing the product or service about which they’ve inquired within one or two years. This percentage is nothing to sneeze at. Yet, according to businesses, only about 1 percent to 5 percent of the ad-related inquiries they get from businesses translate into sales.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_016">John Coe, <em class="emphasis">The Fundamentals of Business-to-Business Sales</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003), 125.</span> That’s a big gap. In other words, a lot of valuable leads can slip through your fingers if you don’t follow up and qualify them.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Sales Funnel</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s02_p01">If you talked to a guidance counselor when you were applying to colleges, he probably told you to consider several and then apply to a number of schools (more than just two or three) even though you would only end up choosing one school in the end. This is because not all the schools that you apply to end up being a good fit. Sometimes you aren’t accepted, sometimes you are accepted but don’t get an ideal financial package, and sometimes as you learn more about a school you decide it isn’t the right one for you. Whatever the reason, you start out by considering many schools and generally end up deciding between a few.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s02_p02">The same can be said of the selling process. In fact, the process is often compared to a funnel. You start out with many leads, and after gathering more information, you come up with a smaller list of qualified prospects. As you communicate with these potential customers and work toward a solution, some will turn out to be more likely to buy than others. It’s common sense to assume that you will have more leads than you have buyers since not all leads turn into customers. The concept of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sales funnel</a><span class="glossdef">An illustration of the way the sales process begins with a large pool of prospects and ends with a more focused number of buyers.</span></span> is a helpful way to visualize the process of finding and qualifying your customers and effectively illustrates the value of identifying a large pool of potential prospects. If you don’t bother to find more than a handful of leads, you limit your chances of ever closing a sale no matter how much effort you put into your sales presentation. It’s a common temptation that most people want the results without having to put in the foundational work of finding and contacting prospects.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s02_s02_p03">But wait a minute, you might think, “Isn’t it hugely inefficient to spend time and effort communicating with so many prospects with the expectation that only a handful of those will turn out to be buyers?” This is also true, which is why qualifying and prioritizing your prospects is such an important part of the sales process. Technological tools like collaborative communities and other online resources can help you identify, qualify, and prioritize prospects. But you might wonder how do you decide which prospects you should invest your time in pursuing. To begin with, you should create a profile of your ideal buyer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_017">Ron Hubsher, interview by Gerhard Gschwandtner, <em class="emphasis">Daily Report</em>, Sales Optimization Group, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesog.com/index.html">http://www.salesog.com/index.html</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p01">It costs five times more to attract a new customer than to keep an existing customer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_020">Jeff Bressler, “How Much to Spend to Acquire New Customers?” <em class="emphasis">CEO World Magazine</em>, May 13, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2009/05/13/hto-much-to-spend-to-acquire-new-customers">http://ceoworld.biz/ceo/2009/05/13/hto-much-to-spend-to-acquire-new-customers</a> (accessed June 10, 2009).</span> So it stands to reason that your best new customers are your existing customers. Salespeople who make an effort to deliver excellent customer service during <em class="emphasis">and</em> after a sale know the secret that some of their best prospects are the customers they already have. To keep and develop your existing customers, love them, service them, be partners with them, live and breathe in their world, understand them, and anticipate their needs, and you will succeed in sales.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s01_p02">One of the keys to retaining your best customers is to keep in touch with your customers’ needs and update your solutions as their needs change. Say you work for a marketing company that offers a variety of services to businesses. One of your customers, a record company, is using your printing services, but they’re turning to another organization for their public relations needs. If you’re aware of this, your existing customer is now a prospect for additional sales. You might tell the record company, “You know, your current PR people are setting up events and concerts to increase your publicity, and that seems to be working only moderately well. If we were running your PR, we would integrate your events with a variety of other media. For instance, we think a blog would be a hugely effective tool.…” If the company is already a loyal customer and you let them know that you are aware of their needs and can offer a better solution, then you may very well make a new sale.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Power Prospecting Source #2: Referrals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p01">There’s nothing more powerful than getting information about a product or service from a friend or people you trust before you buy. Think about the last time you bought a printer. You probably checked out the customer reviews on Amazon, asked your friends, checked out some blogs, and maybe even got some insights on Twitter (in 140 characters or less). Before you bought the Hewlett-Packard (HP) OfficeJet 6310, you knew exactly what to expect from people who have bought and used the product, and you learned that if you buy it at Office Depot, you get free shipping and two free ink cartridges. Although you never shopped at Office Depot before, you were sold before you even clicked “buy now” on the Office Depot’s Web site. Imagine that you didn’t even come in contact with HP or Office Depot. You made your purchase based solely on the information from others. The power of the referral cannot be underestimated.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p02">Referrals and word-of-mouth advertising have always been one of the most effective—and cost-efficient—ways to get new customers. It used to be that the circle of referrals was limited to people who used your product or service in a given geographic area. The Internet has amplified that network, especially with user-generated content such as communities, blogs, customer ratings and reviews, and social networking sites. So as a salesperson, you have to think creatively about all of resources you have to generate referrals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p03">Seth Godin, best-selling author and entrepreneur, talks about “flipping the funnel.” He challenges salespeople to think about turning the sales funnel on its side, thinking of it as a megaphone, and then handing the megaphone to those who already love you. He suggests that when many of your customers enter into the conversation on Web sites such as Digg, Flickr, and Delicious, the power of your message gets even stronger, and new referrals find you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_021">Seth Godin, “How to Flip the Sales Funnel,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McmEyr0oWew">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McmEyr0oWew</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span> Listen to Seth describe how your customers can be your best salespeople.</p>

When Naked Pizza, a small takeout and delivery operation in New Orleans, decided they wanted to compete with the city’s chain pizza places, they turned to their existing customer base for sales prospects by putting their Twitter address on every pizza box that went out the door. As Jeff, Randy, and Brock, the company’s founders put it, “Even your most core customers must be continually and softly nudged.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_022">Jeff Leach, Randy Crochet, and Brock Fillinger, “How One Small Business Uses Twitter to Build Its Brand,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, May 29, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com">http://adage.com</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span> The prospecting effort has been a huge success with their existing customers posting tweets that have introduced the brand to new customers. The Twitter-enabled follow-ups allowed Naked Pizza to continue the conversation and ensure that a greater number of first-time buyers become repeat customers—and that <em class="emphasis">they</em> spread the word to more new customers. Talk about a megaphone!</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s02_p05">Whether you sell pizza or insurance, if your existing customers are happy, they’re usually happy to refer you to their friends, online or offline. Consider Flycaster &amp; Company, a Florida-based branding and advertising agency for businesses. For a number of years now, almost 100 percent of the firm’s new customers have been referred to them by friends and colleagues. According to John Spence, one of the company’s managers, referrals are the “best possible” source of prospects for any B2B business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_023">John Spence, “Seven Steps to Successful B2B Marketing,” John Spence Blog, comment posted October 31, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://johnspence.com/blog/?p=52">http://johnspence.com/blog/?p=52</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Power Prospecting Source #3: Networking and Social Networking</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s03_p01">Networking works.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s03_p02">The art of networking, developing mutually beneficial relationships, can be a valuable prospecting tool, not only for retaining old prospects, but also for connecting with new ones. The larger and more diverse your network becomes, the bigger your pool of potential prospects. Your networking connections often become sources of referrals for your business, just as you will become a referral source for theirs.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s03_p03">If you’re a member of the American Chemical Society and you work for a chemical supply company, you might use your membership to get acquainted with chemists who work at a variety of labs. You could offer them your card and let them know that you provide supply discounts for fellow Chemical Society members. Now these prospects will be more likely to buy their chemical supplies from you than from a company or individual with whom they have no personal connection. If one of your customers needs a chemist with a particular specialty, you, in turn, will be able to refer him to someone in your network. Joining a professional trade association is one simple way to network with others in your field, or with prospects in your target industry.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s03_p04">If your business is location specific, joining community organizations can also be a valuable tool for connecting with local business leaders and prospects. Consider service organizations (like the Rotary Club), fraternity organizations, and other affinity groups that will allow you to build relationships with members of the community.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s03_p05">What about social networking? You’re probably well acquainted with online social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace, but you may be less familiar with the ways people leverage these tools in a professional capacity. According to professional networking expert Clara Shih, online social networks can be an effective means of prospecting for sales with organizations. After all, the decision makers at any organization are <em class="emphasis">individuals</em> with whom you can build relationships (remember, you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a> that even though it’s called business-to-business, buying decisions are made person-to-person, so relationships matter).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_024">Clara Shih, <em class="emphasis">The Facebook Era</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2009), 2.</span> By connecting socially with key individuals, not only can you open lines of communications with potential customers, but you can also build your knowledge of your prospect base.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s03_p06">Professional networking sites like LinkedIn are increasingly important as well. (In fact, the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of this chapter includes information about how you can use professional social networking sites to help you network to find a job.) And there are many industry-specific networking sites you can join, like Sermo for doctors or INmobile.org for people in the wireless industry.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_025">Jessica E. Vascellaro, “Social Networking Goes Professional,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, August 28, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118825239984310205.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118825239984310205.html</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span> Your profile on professional networking sites becomes a tool for selling yourself as a brand. These sites allow you to list your education, professional experience, and testimonials from satisfied customers, and as you add contacts, you become connected to their contacts, allowing your network to grow.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_026">Clara Shih, <em class="emphasis">The Facebook Era</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2009), 2.</span></p>

It might surprise you to know that your local library can actually be a potential goldmine for finding prospects in B2B sales. If you spend even twenty minutes with a knowledgeable librarian, he can point you to business lists, journals, and business directories that will help you generate a pool of leads to contact. Your ideal customer profile is an important guiding tool here.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s04_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">If you want customer information that’s location specific</strong>, check out your local chamber of commerce listing. It’s one of the best sources for finding local businesses. If the listing is not at the local library, chances are the librarian will have the contact information for the chamber office.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s04_p03">You can also review business lists and directories published by local newspapers and regional business journals. Local newspapers and their Web sites often provide listings of local businesses along with key information about the company. Also, the <em class="emphasis">Book of Lists</em> is published locally by the American City Business Journals in several cities—for example, the <em class="emphasis">Philadelphia Business Journal</em> publishes the <em class="emphasis">Book of Lists</em> for the Philadelphia, South Jersey, and Delaware area. It is a book that includes lists of companies organized by groupings. For instance, the fastest-growing companies, minority-owned businesses, and lists of companies by industry such as video production companies, health care companies, public relations agencies, law firms, and more are included with the contact information, profiles, and key facts for specific businesses in your state or city. You can generally find these books at your local library, and they’re an excellent source for digging up prospects that most closely match your ideal profile. Business lists are also published by other business journals such as <em class="emphasis">Crain’s</em> in some key cities or are available online (also see Power Prospecting Source #6: Trade Journals and Business Journals below).</p>

NAICS and SIC codes are numbering systems that classify businesses by their particular industry, so they can be valuable search criteria to mine general business directories (e.g., <em class="emphasis">Ward’s Business Directory of U.S. Private and Public Companies</em>) for specific kinds of companies. For example, you could use the SIC code 6371 to find all businesses that deal with pension, health, and welfare funds.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_027">Occupational Health and Safety Administration, “SIC Search,” United States Department of Labor, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.display?id=56&amp;tab=group">http://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/sic_manual.display?id=56&amp;tab=group</a> (accessed June 9, 2009).</span> You can also search through <em class="emphasis">industry-specific</em> directories like the <em class="emphasis">Standard Directory of Advertisers</em>, and you can check out professional <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade associations</a><span class="glossdef">An organization whose members are individuals or businesses that operate in a specific industry.</span></span> related to your prospect profile.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s05_p01">Going to the library can be hugely helpful because it gives you access to people who are pros at finding information. Also, the <em class="emphasis">added</em> perk is that your library will probably give you free access to several online business directories and databases.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_030">Boston Public Library, “Directories on the Internet,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bpl.org/research/kbb/websites/dirs.htm">http://www.bpl.org/research/kbb/websites/dirs.htm</a> (accessed February 15, 2010).</span> Of course you can search these directories from the comfort of your own home or office, but if you want the deluxe package—the most up-to-date directories that cover industries of all types nationwide—you’ll have to pay a price. Online business directories, such as those listed in the table below, are searchable by industry and will give you access to company contact info, number of employees, financial standing, industry rankings, names of executives, and other company profile information. Most of these directories allow you to search businesses by SIC or NAICS codes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s05_p02">So how do you know which business directory to use? For one thing, it helps to know whether your ideal prospect would be a private company or a public company or whether it could be either. Is your ideal prospect a large organization that attracts top executives? In this case, you’ll mostly be searching for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">public companies</a><span class="glossdef">A company that sells stocks and bonds to the general public.</span></span>—companies that sell stocks and bonds to the general public. Public companies are required to file financial information and other company reports with the U.S. government, so these organizations are easier to find in general business directories, and their directory listings usually provide more detailed company information.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_031">Center for Business Research, “Public vs. Private Companies,” Long Island University, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/cbr/publicvprivate.htm">http://www2.liu.edu/cwis/cwp/library/cbr/publicvprivate.htm</a> (accessed June 10, 2009).</span> However, not all large companies are publicly owned.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s05_p03">Another thing to consider is whether you want the option to refine your search to include a number of criteria closely matching your ideal prospect profile.

Trade show booths usually have a place for leads to enter their contact information so you can follow up with your prospects and save leads in your customer database. If you are a sales representative for a textbook company and you attend a faculty book fair at a large university, when professors stop by your booth, you might ask them which texts they are currently using and what they like or dislike about these books. This is a quick way to identify potential need. One professor might tell you she uses such-and-such a textbook, which is thorough, but her students don’t find it very engaging. Aha! You have identified a need, and you now have a prospect. You might tell the professor about a textbook that covers similar information but uses a more conversational style and ask if she would like you to send her a complimentary copy. If she says yes, you now have an opportunity to take her contact information, and you have permission to follow up.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s09_p01">In the last ten years, Pat Cavanaugh, CEO of a Pittsburgh-based promotional products company, has grown his business 2,000 percent—and he’s done almost all of it through cold calling. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cold calling</a><span class="glossdef">Making an unsolicited phone call or visit to a sales lead.</span></span>, or making an unsolicited phone call or visit to a prospective customer, can be quite effective for the salespeople who know the right approach, but it’s also most salespeople’s least favorite prospecting activity. For one thing, you never know whether the person on the other end of the line will be rude or hang up on you altogether. Additionally, most salespeople feel pressured to actually sell their product or make a pitch during a cold call, but according to Cavanaugh, cold calling isn’t about making sales; it’s about establishing a connection with the prospect.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_039">Susan Greco, “The Nonstop, 24-7 CEO Salesman,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, August 2000, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20000801/19766.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20000801/19766.html</a> (accessed June 11, 2009).</span></p>

Remember, you don’t have to sell your product during the call; the goal is only to make a positive connection. You don’t have to lay the schmooze on either. Instead, be direct and sincere, and be yourself. Your prospect, who is probably very busy, will appreciate directness and brevity.</p>

If you know you can’t help your lead solve her problems, you shouldn’t pursue the call further.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_041">Hanzo Ng, “Prospecting, Cold Calling &amp; Networking,” <em class="emphasis">Malaysian Business</em>, October 1, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn6207/is_20081001/ai_n30902653/?tag=content;col1">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn6207/is_20081001/ai_n30902653/?tag=content;col1</a> (accessed June 11, 2009).</span> A cold call is a perfect way to find out at what stage the lead is in of his buying process. She might still be a lead for future sales, but at this time she isn’t a qualified prospect. For that matter, if your lead seems unreceptive, you might also decide to end the call or to offer to try back at another time. Ultimately, it’s important that your prospective buyer doesn’t feel like she’s being pressured in any way; people have come to expect pushy salesmen and saleswomen on the phone, and you want to set yourself apart from this perception.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s09_p04">If the lead <em class="emphasis">does</em> have a problem that you can address, you should go ahead and offer to make an appointment to meet in person. Again, there should be no pressure on either end; your prospect will accept an appointment if she is interested. If she doesn’t agree to an appointment, don’t try to press it. Sometimes, it may simply be a matter of timing: your prospect might ask you to call back in few months. In this case, get your calendar out and set up a <em class="emphasis">specific</em> time when you can try to call back. For instance, “Three months from now will be early March. Is it all right for me to try calling again then?” If she agrees, go a step further and ask something like this: “In the meantime, would it be OK if I sent you occasional updates by e-mail to let you know about new developments and promotions with our product?” This enables you to periodically follow up so that you maintain a connection with your lead.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_042">Keith Rosen, “Keep the Lines of Communication with Your Prospects Open,” AllBusiness, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/sales-management/4001387-1.html">http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/sales-management/4001387-1.html</a> (accessed June 11, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s09_p05">Finally, it’s important to research your prospect before making a call. You should know the size and scope of the company, key people, company culture, and anything about the company that has recently come up in the news. Doing your research allows you to personalize your introduction. After explaining who you are, you might say, “I recently read in <em class="emphasis">Crain’s Chicago Business</em> that your company’s number one priority in the coming year is doubling revenues by increasing your sales force….” Doing your research and keeping a few simple tips in mind should take the pressure off in cold calling and give you the confidence to establish crucial prospect connections.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s10_p01">Wouldn’t it be great if, rather than going out to track down prospects, you could get your prospects to come to you? Presenting yourself as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subject matter expert</a><span class="glossdef">Being an authority in a specific industry or topic.</span></span>, an authority in your field, is one secret for making this happen. CEO and consultant Keith Ferrazzi, started using this technique shortly after graduating from college. Even though he didn’t have much experience under his belt as a new graduate, he picked an area and began researching until others in his industry came to know him as an expert and would go to him for consultation and advice. Set up a blog or write articles offering free advice.

For instance, maybe you work for a company that sells résumé and cover letter consulting services for job seekers. You decide to write an article explaining “10 Things to Avoid When Dressing for a Job Interview,” and you post the article on your blog and submit it to CollegeGrad, a Web site that publishes helpful blog posts like yours. You allow CollegeGrad to use your article for free in exchange for posting a link to your Web site in the margins of the Web page. Now when people perform a Google search on “dressing for a job interview,” your article may come up, ensuring that a number of people who match your ideal prospect profile see the information about you and your product.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s01_s10_p03">When generating B2B leads, you can often find prospects by offering Web-based seminars, or Webinars, with helpful advice on some aspect of marketing, or by publishing informative reports (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">white papers</a><span class="glossdef">An informative report that offers practical solutions to a specific problem.</span></span>) that people can download for free. For instance, a marketing consulting firm might offer a white paper on “Increasing Your Open Rate on E-mails” that businesses can download for free as long as they register their information on the firm’s Web page. Requiring users to register allows the firm to track contact information for new leads with whom they can then follow up by e-mail, cold call, or mail. Even better, if a lead finds that the free advice they downloaded is useful, they will quite likely contact the firm voluntarily to find out about the marketing services they provide.</p>

If the individual with whom you’ve been doing business at a particular company leaves, you should update that in your database and begin prospecting for another lead at the company. If you’ve recently mailed information to some of your leads, CRM software will help you keep track of which customers the mailing went to and how recently it went out, so you know when to follow up with those prospects by phone. You have a huge range of CRM programs from which to choose, and while these applications were once large-business luxuries, more recently there are versions that are priced within the reach of smaller businesses as well.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_045">Karen M.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p02">On the other hand, depending on the type of sales and prospecting your company does, you may only need to use a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contact management system (CMS)</a><span class="glossdef">A system for tracking and organizing customer and prospect information that is less complex than CRM and doesn’t necessarily keep a record of every customer contact.</span></span>, a system that keeps track of your customer calls and meetings, which is usually less expensive than CRM software. CMS programs are another means of tracking and organizing customer and prospect information, but unlike CRM, CMS programs don’t track all information about every customer interaction. If you are the only person from your organization dealing with a particular prospect (e.g., if you’re a stockbroker or a real estate agent), you usually only need CMS software. The CMS will allow you to keep current contact and company information on your prospects and to record detailed notes about your conversations with them. But if your company uses multiple methods and/or multiple salespeople to communicate with a prospect (think Zappos.com or Best Buy), then CRM will be a better tool so that each salesperson who interacts with the customer can record their interactions with that individual or company and so that your organization know how and when to follow up.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_046">Andrew Boyd and Alex Jeffries, “The Crucial Difference Between Contact Management and CRM,” <em class="emphasis">E-commerce Times</em>, January 29, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/smb/65995.html?wlc=1244423929">http://www.ecommercetimes.com/story/smb/65995.html?wlc=1244423929</a> (accessed June 11, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s02_s02_p01">If you know your prospect is an eight-year-old online auction house with fifty-two employees operating out of Atlanta, that’s information—statistics you regularly update in your customer databases. These are facts that your competitors can also easily access using a simple online directory search. But what about the last time you visited your prospect in person? While waiting to meet with your contact, you overheard the receptionist talking about the complaints the company had been getting recently because of their confusing Web page layout. If you represent a Web design firm, that’s valuable information, and it’s news your competitor can’t access. In other words, it’s not just information, it’s <em class="emphasis">intelligence</em>. You can use this intelligence to your advantage when you put it together with other information. In this situation, assume you happen to know that one of the competing design firms in town just lost its best online retail specialist, while <em class="emphasis">your</em> company has two designers who have worked with similar online retailers in the past. So you know your company can address your prospect’s need in a unique way. Now you’re armed with <em class="emphasis">competitive intelligence</em>. Keeping your eyes and ears open for intelligence during every interaction is an important part of prospecting, and it’s particularly important to track the intelligence you gather in your customer databases. You never know when it might prove useful.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s02_s02_p02">It’s also helpful to think about information that will help you make a personal connection to your prospect (remember from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a> how important the emotional connection is). Your observations and information gathering should carry over to personal details like your prospect’s family, his birthday, or his hobbies. Include these insights as part of your organized records, too. It might seem strange at first to make a formal record of personal details, but keeping track of things like the name of your prospect’s two children sends the message that you care about the person, not just his business, and this in turn builds customer loyalty. Upscale hotels like the Four Seasons do this kind of customer relationship management particularly well. Receptionists and concierges track personal details of repeat customers, learning to greet them by name and ask about specific details from previous visits: “Did your sister like the gift you bought her last time you were here?” or “How was your recent trip to Japan?”</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s02_s03_p01">Things can change quickly in business, particularly at large companies. The account manager you spoke with last month may have moved to another company yesterday, or the purchasing agent who seemed excited about your product last year may have had to deal with significant budget cuts this year that prevent him from buying again. That’s why it’s crucial to keep your prospect information current. If your competitor sees an opportunity before you do, you’re likely to lose yourself a prospect. And if the individual with whom you’ve been doing business at a company is no longer working there, it’s important to find another key person to contact soon if you want to keep your customer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s02_s03_p02">Several online business directories (like those mentioned earlier) let you subscribe to customized alerts that will notify you when one of your target companies appears in the news, when there’s turnover of key personnel, or when companies in your industry merge or split off. Most of the directory services have a fee, but there are a number of ways to stay current, on industry news at least, without paying. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) readers (Microsoft Outlook has one, and so does Google) allow you to subscribe to specific news feeds, like <em class="emphasis">The Hollywood Reporter</em> or <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>’s Web page, so that you can keep abreast of the news that affects your industry without having to go out and mine several Web pages every day.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s03_p01">After you’ve identified your prospects, it’s important to understand that <em class="emphasis">all customers are not created equal</em>. Some customers are willing to form business partnerships and grow with you over time while others are just looking to do business with whoever offers the lowest price. Some prospects may never be able to help you or your company achieve your business goals, or their goals may not be strategically aligned with yours, even if you really like doing business with them. Choosing customers carefully will save you time and energy and help you meet you goals. You don’t want to spend several hours writing up a proposal for one of your prospects only to find out they were never genuinely interested.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_047">Paul Cherry, <em class="emphasis">Questions That Sell: The Powerful Process of Discovering What Your Customer Really Wants</em> (New York: AMACOM, 2006), 37.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s03_p02">Think back to the sales funnel and the idea that you start out with a large pool of leads and end with a much smaller number of customers. While it is important to cast your nets broadly when you’re rounding up leads, you’ll work most effectively if you weed out the likely from the unlikely early on. You can qualify your leads to determine whether they are legitimate prospects by discovering whether they have the <em class="emphasis">willingness</em> and the <em class="emphasis">ability</em> to make a purchase. Consider these five questions to help you meet your qualifying objectives:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does your prospect have a need?</strong> This is the most basic thing to figure out about your prospect. There is no use pursuing another individual in the company or delivering a persuasive presentation if there is nothing you can do for this person or organization. If you sell new cars, and your lead is satisfied with the car he bought three months ago, you don’t have anything to offer him.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does he or she have the authority to make the buying decision?</strong> You can try to sell candy to a five-year-old, and he’ll probably want to buy it, but unless you can convince his parents to make the purchase you don’t have a sale. Similarly, your lead at a company may love your product and tell you it’s exactly what her company needs. But if she isn’t the person with the power to buy, she isn’t a qualified prospect. This doesn’t mean you should write the company off, but you’ll have to figure out how to get in touch with the person who <em class="emphasis">can</em> make the buying decision.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does he or she have the resources to purchase the product or service?</strong> Sometimes knowing the answer to this question involves contacting the lead and asking some questions. Other times, you can figure this out by doing company research before ever getting in touch with the lead. You wouldn’t have tried to make a major sale to Circuit City just before they went out of business because they wouldn’t have had the resources to buy.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does he or she have the willingness to purchase the product?</strong> Even if your lead has the resources and authority to buy, he might not be interested in what you’re selling. He might be dead set on a Caribbean cruise when you are selling packages to a ski resort.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do you have access to the influencer or decision makers?</strong> This is relatively straightforward in B2C sales, but in B2B, it can be hard. If you wanted to sell your clothing line to Macy’s, you couldn’t go downtown to your local branch and pitch your product. Large organizations have layers of personnel, and it’s challenging to ferret out the people whose can influence the buying decision. Think about whether you <em class="emphasis">can</em> reasonably access these individuals.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s04_p01">So you’ve qualified your prospect and you have his or her information in your CRM system.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s04_p02">After qualifying, you might have some prospects with a clear need, buying authority, and a fairly high level of interest, while others seem uncertain.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s03_s04_p03">Finally, think about the next steps in the sales process. Based on this customer’s specific needs, how will you design your preapproach? What details should be in your presentation, when should you make your presentation, and how and when will you try to close? Develop a timeline and plot out the steps. If you can envision the sale, you are already halfway there.</p>

This is especially true if you’re applying during peak times (e.g., the beginning of summer, when all the students are looking for work at once) when you know that tens, maybe hundreds of others, are sending in applications for the same positions. The good news is that now that you know about prospecting and qualifying, you are in control of your job search and have the power to set yourself apart from your competitors.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Three Steps to Prospecting for the Right Employer</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_p01">You don’t have to limit yourself to a handful of job prospects. Once you know where to look, you’ll be overwhelmed with the possibilities. There is no need to wait for your prospects to post job openings or to find your résumé somewhere and approach you; instead, <em class="emphasis">you</em> identify your “buyer” and approach them. Most job seekers look for advertised positions through Internet job sites, newspaper want ads, or employment agencies. This is a fair starting point, especially if some of your target companies have posted vacancies. But it’s important to know that only about one-fifth of the jobs are actually advertised this way.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_049">Katherine Hansen and Randall Hansen, <em class="emphasis">Dynamic Cover Letters: How to Write the Letter That Gets You the Job</em> (Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press, 2001), 2.</span> The other four out of five positions are never publicly announced; they might be filled internally, by networking (covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>), or through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cold-contact (or unsolicited) applications</a><span class="glossdef">Employment prospecting in which the applicant submits a cover letter and résumé even though a position has not been advertised.</span></span>. This means that prospecting and qualifying potential employers (whether or not they are advertising for a position) is likely to yield good results, provided you do your research first.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_p02">If this sounds far-fetched—<em class="emphasis">What? You can send an application when there’s no job posting?</em>—think about J. Crew. When the company has new merchandise, they send out a catalog. You don’t usually request the catalog, but when it comes, if you like J. Crew’s products, you’ll take a look, and you might just buy. Just because a company hasn’t posted a position doesn’t mean there isn’t a need. Let them know what you have to offer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_050">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p01">If you could work for your dream company, what would it look like? Would it be a fast-paced, competitive environment with good opportunities for advancement? Would it be a creative organization where you could work collaboratively with like-minded individuals? Would it be a company that includes social responsibility as part of its mission statement? Would you work for a nonprofit, where you could see firsthand the difference you were making in the world? Just as you begin prospecting by building an ideal customer profile,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_051">Brian Carroll, “10 Lead Generating (Prospecting) Tips for Sales People,” B2B Lead Generation Blog, May 21, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/05/10_lead_generat.html#ixzz0GAhpeddB&amp;B">http://blog.startwithalead.com/weblog/2007/05/10_lead_generat.html#ixzz0GAhpeddB&amp;B</a> (accessed June 11, 2009).</span> you should also prospect potential employers by visualizing your ideal work environment.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p02">Consider not only the criteria that are most important to you (e.g., benefits, company values, advancement opportunities), but also location. Do you want to stay in a particular region of the country? Is it important that you live in or near a big city? Do you want to live somewhere with good outdoor recreation? Is there some other condition that matters to you? You’re free to choose. FindYourSpot.com is a resource that can help you with your location decision. You can also look at lists like Relocate-America’s Best Places to Live and then visit Salary.com (use the Cost of Living Wizard) to determine how much more or less it will cost you to live in your favorite location.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p03">Finally, you should consider which employers will be interested in the skills you have to offer. But don’t sell yourself short here, either. Just as in prospecting you should never write off a lead without investigating it, <em class="emphasis">you should also never write off a lead in your job search</em>. If you can see how your skills would benefit a company, that company is a potential employer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p04">Essentially, there are three things to consider when you build your prospective employer profile:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>What are the most important characteristics of your ideal company?</li>
                <li>In which location would you most like to live?</li>
                <li>Which companies might be interested in the skills you have to offer in return?</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s01_p05">You can use all these factors as guidelines to generate a list of target companies. Building the ideal company profile isn’t about saying “wouldn’t it be nice if.…” Instead, it’s about empowering you to go out and find the employer for whom you want to work.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Make a List of 25 Target Companies</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p01">So how many companies should you consider? Definitely more than the four or five that have recently posted ads in your local paper. Think about the sales funnel model: cast your net broadly to begin, but after some qualifying research, you should have a list of at least twenty-five prospects you’d like to target. Don’t define your targets too narrowly. For instance, if you’re going into accounting, consider service providers (accounting firms), but also consider companies that have an accounting department and recruiting firms that are interested in people with your skills.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_052">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 140.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p02">Twenty-five prospects is a good rule of thumb for the top of your funnel because it doesn’t leave you with so many that you will overwhelm yourself with research and applications, but it is enough to allow for the fact that some prospects will drop out along the way. After additional research and contact with your prospects, you will find that some don’t meet your qualifications after all. Some companies in turn might not be willing to give you an interview; others might give you an interview, and even hang onto your résumé, but will tell you they don’t have any openings at the moment. Others might give you an interview but decide your qualifications aren’t what they are looking for. Even as the funnel narrows, an initial pool of twenty-five prospects should leave you with a number of companies that are interested in you and in whom you are also interested. Just as you learned earlier in this chapter, prospecting is never ending so you should always be adding new qualified prospects to your target company list.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s02_p03">Finally, it is critical that as you define your prospects and perform your research, you keep records. Think about the contact management systems businesses use to organize and track their prospects. While you don’t need such a complex system for a job search, taking notes on Post-its or scraps of paper that you <em class="emphasis">might</em> or <em class="emphasis">might not</em> find later on, or trying to commit details to memory, will sabotage your hard work. You can use a simple spreadsheet in Excel to organize and track prospective employer information. Even if you don’t consider yourself an organized person, if you use a simple tool like this one, you have the ability to keep your job search organized—and make your life much easier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Forget about “To Whom It May Concern”</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p01">If you ever get mail addressed to “Resident at (your address),” you know that these are the letters that end up straight in the trash. If someone can’t be bothered to find out your name, you won’t bother yourself to read their mail. The same is true with your job search: keep in mind that <em class="emphasis">people</em>, not organizations or departments, are ultimately responsible for hiring. So it’s essential to find key individuals at each company, especially when you’re sending out cold-contact cover letters and résumés. You want to make sure your letters actually get read, and if you open your letter with a general, impersonal address, it immediately sends the message that you don’t care enough to learn about the company and its people—more likely than not, your letter will end up in the recycle bin.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_053">Katherine Hansen and Randall Hansen, <em class="emphasis">Dynamic Cover Letters: How to Write the Letter That Gets You the Job</em> (Berkeley, CA: Ten Speed Press, 2001), 4.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p02">On the other hand, a little knowledge can go a long way. If a letter with the hiring manager’s name on it comes across his desk, he isn’t likely to ignore it. The best thing to do is begin with the company’s general number listed on their Web site (or in a directory or phone book) and ask the receptionist for the name, contact info, and title for the hiring manager in your field. If the receptionist gives you the name of the human resources manager, be persistent until you get the name of either the hiring manager, the head of your targeted department, or the company president (if it is a smaller organization). Especially if a company hasn’t announced that they are hiring, sending a letter to human resources means that your hiring manager—who might very well be interested in what you have to offer—will probably never receive your application. If calling the company’s general number doesn’t get you the contact information you need, the directory of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.corporateaffiliations.com">Corporate Affiliations</a> is an online source where you can find contact information for the key individuals in many companies.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s01_s03_p03">You might think that you should send only one letter to each company. Don’t stop there! Increase your chances of getting a call by sending as many letters as possible to appropriate hiring managers at each company. For example, if you are applying to an advertising agency for a position in account management, send a letter to the agency president, vice president of account services, account directors, account supervisors, even account executives. Don’t be afraid to send your letter to people like the president or vice president. Often times they will pass it along to the hiring manager and ask him to follow up with you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_054">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed.

You can start by choosing the specific area of your field you’d like to focus on.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn07_055">“Do the Research That Supports Your Job Search,” The Riley Guide, May 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://rileyguide.com/jsresearch.html#r201">http://rileyguide.com/jsresearch.html#r201</a> (accessed June 11, 2009).</span> For instance, an environmental designer might choose to specialize in sustainability issues, health care environments, or the design of retail spaces. Your prospects should be the companies who hire people with your skill set and particular focus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s02_p02">A number of good online business databases can get you started here; many are the same directories and databases you would use to find prospective buyers for your products (see the previous section). Keep in mind that while many of these databases charge a fee for their services, your local or school library should have free subscriptions. Directories are good resources for finding industry-specific companies (e.g., accounting firms if you’re an accountant). But since you want to keep your search open to several kinds of companies, try using a combination of prospecting sources.</p>

You can try membership lists for professional organizations, such as the American Marketing Association or the American Institute of Architects. It’s especially helpful to look for local chapters or organizations in the city in which you would like to work. For example, at the Philly Ad Club’s Web site, you can find a list of over one hundred advertising agencies in the region. Trade publications and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Business_to_Business/News_and_Media/Magazines/Trade_magazines">trade Web sites</a> are good sources for industry and employment information as well—as are business journals and business journal Web sites. Just as you might subscribe to an RSS (Really Simple Syndication) feed or Google News Alerts to stay up-to-date on your leads and competitors in business prospecting, you can do the same when prospecting for employers by subscribing to feeds for trade Web sites or business journals. Again, don’t underestimate the effectiveness of going to your local library. Ask your librarian to point you to some business lists, journals, and directories and take advantage of their free online subscriptions.</p>

For instance, if family-friendly companies are a priority, you could search <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.workingmother.com/?service=vpage/3214"><em class="emphasis">Working Mother</em>’s list of “100 Best Companies</a>,” or if you want a workplace with young employees that offers good training and opportunities for advancement, you might search <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.collegegrad.com/topemployers/2009_entry_level.php?&amp;CCID=20103387203534814&amp;QTR=ZZf200909161031530Za20103387Zg172Zw41Zm504Zc203534814Zs6442ZZ&amp;CLK=566100219063548500&amp;&amp;exp=y">CollegeGrad.com’s list of “Top Entry Level Employers</a>.” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2009/full_list"><em class="emphasis">Fortune</em></a> publishes an annual list of the top one hundred companies to work for overall (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2009">http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2009</a>), and they also provide top company lists by state, if you are considering a particular region of the country. Of course, the “Fastest-Growing Companies” list in national and local business publications is always a good reference with which to start.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Qualifying Prospective Employers: Four Things to Consider</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_p01">After doing industry research, you might have a fairly large list of potential companies, but you can narrow it down to your twenty-five targets by doing more directed research on each of your prospects.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Company Web Sites</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s01_p01">According to Amazon’s Web site, the company defines itself as technologically innovative, customer-centric, and a global leader in e-commerce. If you were to browse the Safeco Insurance Web site, you would find a company that describes their core values as diversity and an inclusive work environment, community outreach and sponsorship, and service that reaches a broad customer base. Any company’s Web site will give you insight into how the company presents itself: their mission and values, the benefits of the products and services they offer, and the culture they want to cultivate. The design of the Web site itself can tell you something about the company. Are they conservative or cutting edge and creative? Is the page well organized and well maintained, or is it convoluted and difficult to navigate? Additionally, even if you plan to cold-contact an employer, the company’s <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/career_centers">career page</a> will let you know if the organization has any advertised vacancies.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Insider Perspectives</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s02_p01">The Web site lets you know what the <em class="emphasis">company</em> wants you to know about itself. But what about what other people are saying about a company? That’s certainly something that you’ll want to find out. Some Web sites, like Vault or WetFeet, offer honest, insider profiles of companies based on employee surveys about things like company culture, dress code, diversity, hours, vacation time, and opportunities for advancement. Does the company have a relaxed atmosphere? Do they expect employees to work long hours? These are things that the company Web site itself won’t tell you.</p>

        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s03">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Company News</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s03_p01">It’s also a good idea to check the news for the latest on what’s happening in a company. While companies promote their own good news, the media picks up everything in between. For instance, when the MGM Mirage corporation was facing massive debt and the possible failure of its extravagant City Center construction project, the news hit major papers across the country. But if you had gone to the company’s Web site or checked their press releases, you would have found announcements about “cost savings,” followed by praise for the scope and incredible amenities of the Mirage’s construction project—clearly a very different picture. To get company news, you can search national news sites for archived articles, or if you want to learn about a smaller, localized company, try searching local newspapers. It’s also a good idea to set up Google News Alerts or subscribe to RSS feeds for your field of interest (see the more detailed explanation in the previous chapter goal) so that you are constantly updating your intelligence, just as you would for a prospective buyer.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Company Stats</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s04_p01">Finally, when qualifying prospective companies, there are a handful of other things to consider. How does the company measure up against its competitors? How large is the company? Is it profitable? For <em class="emphasis">public companies</em> you can use databases like D&amp;B and Hoovers to research stock prices, quarterly earnings, and senior management changes. You can access this information on multiple companies at a time by taking advantage of free database subscriptions at your local library, or you can go to individual company Web sites to gather stats. Publicly held companies usually post recordings of quarterly conference calls with analysts on their Web sites in the investor relations section.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch07_s04_s03_s04_p02">While you won’t be able to research stock prices or quarterly earnings on <em class="emphasis">private companies</em>, you can still find out about personnel turnover using most online databases. Ask yourself how this turnover might affect the way business is conducted and check the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to find out if any complaints have been lodged against the company. Finding an employer that closely matches your ideal profile is well within your power, if you consider yourself—your unique brand—as a solution that can meet a prospective employer’s needs. The prospects are out there just waiting to be identified.</p>
