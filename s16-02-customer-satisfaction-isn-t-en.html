Loyal customers are how successful businesses are built. Not only is it easier to sell more to existing customers, it is financially prudent to do so. Some companies have increased their profit by as much as 100 percent by focusing on retaining an additional 5 percent of customers. Since it costs about five times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing customer, companies are well served to focus on retaining existing customers and making them into advocates for their brand.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_033">Chia-Chi Chang, “When Service Fails: The Role of the Salesperson and the Customer,” <em class="emphasis">Psychology &amp; Marketing</em> 23, no. 3 (March 2006): 204.</span> In other words, “Customer acquisition is an investment, but customer retention delivers profitability.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_034">Guy Maser, “How to Earn Your Customers’ Loyalty,” CRMBuyer.com, July 16, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.crmbuyer.com/story/67608.html">http://www.crmbuyer.com/story/67608.html</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Earlier in this chapter, the five elements of follow-up were discussed including getting feedback from customers. This concept is so important, it’s worth drilling a little deeper into it. It is loyal customers who buy more from you in the form of more products and services more often. Companies that focus on creating customer loyalty usually invest in developing an effective <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer feedback loop</a><span class="glossdef">A formal process for gathering, synthesizing, and acting upon customer feedback.</span></span>, a formal process for gathering, synthesizing, and acting on customer feedback.

For example, Charles Schwab, an online investment services company, has a process whereby managers review customer feedback daily from comments on the company Web site, transactions, and other communications with the company. Managers and sales reps respond personally to negative customer comments. Cheryl Pasquale, a branch manager, says she looks forward to customer calls to follow up on complaints or less-than-positive comments. She feels she has an opportunity to turn “critics into fans.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_035">Rob Markey, Fred Reichheld, and Andreas Dullweber, “Closing the Customer Feedback Loop,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/2009/12/closing-the-customer-feedback-loop/ar/pr">http://hbr.harvardbusiness.org/2009/12/closing-the-customer-feedback-loop/ar/pr</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s02_s02_p01">Successful companies have found that customers can be more than customers; they can be advocates, supporters, promoters, and fans. It’s these passionate fans that not only spend their money with these companies but also tell their friends and ultimately their friends’ friends to patronize the company. The mutual admiration of brand and customer starts with the culture of the company. Those companies that not only listen to their customers but also engage them in communities, new product development, and other improvements are the ones that have a maniacal focus on the customer. They get it. For example, watch this video of a Southwest Airlines flight attendant that was posted to YouTube by a passenger. Talk about being a fan of the brand—it’s hard not to be after you watch this video.</p>

Although shoes have a notoriously high return rate due to fit problems, Zappos offers free shipping both ways to encourage purchases.

As you can see from the formula, customers that are passives (scores of 7 to 8), reflect poorly on the brand’s NPS. Being satisfied isn’t enough; a brand’s goal is to have promoters or fans.
