    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_p01">You walk into an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store at the mall, and without thinking about it, you turn to the right and make your way through the denim, past the belts, and to the sweaters. You are so engaged in the experience that you didn’t even realize that the huge mural at the entrance to the store serves a purpose other than to make you look twice at the hot model in the larger-than-life photo. Before you know it, one of the oh-so-gorgeous salespeople dressed in Abercrombie from head to toe approaches you with a smile. “These hoodies are awesome,” she says as you pick up the pale blue one.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_p02">Shopping. It’s the national pastime for some but a detested necessity for others. Whether you love shopping (“Oh, that is sooooooo cute!”) or do everything to avoid it (“I’m not going to the mall, no matter what”), it is a major source of spending in the United States. In fact, the retail industry generated $4.475 trillion in sales in 2008, including everything from products and services in retail stores and e-commerce to food service and automotive.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_001">Barbara Farfan, “Retail Industry Information: Overview of Facts, Research, Data, and Trivia,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://retailindustry.about.com/od/statisticsresearch/p/retailindustry.htm">http://retailindustry.about.com/od/statisticsresearch/p/retailindustry.htm</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span> That’s a lot of selling—and a lot of buying. But what makes you stop and pick up one sweater but not another? What makes you buy a pair of jeans you weren’t even looking for? What makes you walk out of the store spending more than you had planned?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Inside Consumer Behavior</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s01_p01">The science of consumer behavior describes and even defines how you shop and, more importantly, why you buy. Smart retailers study consumer behavior patterns and lay out their stores and merchandise accordingly. For example, did you know that 86 percent of women look at price tags when they shop, while only 72 percent of men do?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_002">Paco Underhill, <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em> (New York: Touchstone, 1999), 99.</span> And did you know that the average shopper doesn’t actually notice anything that’s in the entrance of a store? According to Paco Underhill, famous marketer, CEO and founder of EnviroSell, and author of the book <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em>, consumers don’t actually begin shopping until a certain point after they enter the store. That’s why smart retailers include a “transition zone” at the entry to their store; it allows customers to get their bearings and choose their shopping paths. In other words, products, signs, and displays that are in the very front of the store might not be seen if there is not a transition for the customers when they enter. In the case of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the transition is the space just inside the entrance that includes the humongous photo of the Abercrombie model du jour. When you go into Hollister, it’s the outside porch that serves the same purpose; it’s a transition that allows you to get your focus and plot your course in the store, even if you don’t consciously realize it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s01_p02">Think about the last time you went into a grocery store or drug store; you might not have noticed anything until you were well inside the store, which means that the merchandise and signs that were displayed in the area before you got your bearings were virtually invisible to you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_003">Paco Underhill, <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em> (New York: Touchstone, 1999), 46.</span> Based on consumer research, there’s a high likelihood that you turned right when you entered the store. Take note the next time you go shopping; chances are, you’ll turn right after you walk in.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_004">Paco Underhill, <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em> (New York: Touchstone, 1999), 46.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s01_p03">Understanding how and why customers buy can make a significant difference in how you sell. Is the product a considered purchase, like a computer or car, or an impulse buy, like a sweater or music download? Is the product bought frequently, like an energy drink, or only once every few years or even once in a lifetime, like a car or a college education? For each of these products, the customer goes through a buying process. Understanding the customer and the buying process can make your selling efforts successful. This video featuring Martin Lindstrom, the author of <em class="emphasis">Buyology: Truths and Lies about Why We Buy</em>, highlights the science of consumer behavior in selling and marketing</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p01">When Hurricane Katrina hit the United States on August 28, 2005, the Gulf Coast was devastated. Thousands of people were stranded for days, some without food, water, or shelter due to overwhelming flooding. Almost two thousand people lost their lives in the natural disaster.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_008">United States Department of Health and Human Services, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/emergency/naturaldisasters/hurricanes/katrina/index.html">http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/emergency/naturaldisasters/hurricanes/katrina/index.html</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> During those horrible days and in the aftermath, those who were affected by the catastrophe did not care what kind of car they drove, what anyone did for a living, or if they forgot to sign up for French or scuba lessons. They were focused on the basics: food, shelter, and clothing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p02">This tragedy is a demonstration of exactly how <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a><span class="glossdef">The behavior theory that recognizes that people are motivated by their most basic needs first; only after those needs are met do they strive to meet higher-level needs.</span></span> works. Abraham Maslow is among the most renowned psychologists of the twentieth century. His theory explains human behavior in simple terms: A hierarchy of needs that begins with the most basic of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">physiological needs</a><span class="glossdef">The most basic elements required to survive such as food, shelter, and clothing.</span></span> (e.g., food, water, shelter, and clothing) motivates people, and when the lowest-level needs are satisfied, they are no longer motivators.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_009"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p03">During the days after Hurricane Katrina hit, people were rescued and provided with water, food, and shelter. Many were relocated to temporary housing or even to housing outside the affected areas. It was not until after the physiological needs were met that people became concerned about the next level of needs on Maslow’s hierarchy: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">safety needs</a><span class="glossdef">Concerns for personal security and well-being.</span></span>. Looting of shops in some of the cities began to occur, and there was even concern that the police force in some cities was not taking an active role in arresting those who were breaking the law.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_010">Associated Press, “Looters Take Advantage of New Orleans Mess,” <em class="emphasis">msnbc.com</em>, August 30, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9131493">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9131493</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> The people of the Gulf Coast were no longer motivated by simply getting water, food, or shelter; they had moved up Maslow’s hierarchy and were concerned about their personal security and well-being.</p>

They searched for options to put their children back in school, ways to get jobs, and options to rebuild their lives. By Christmas 2005, people stopped to celebrate the holiday together. According to a story reported by CBS Evening News on December 25, 2005, about the Christmas gatherings in New Orleans, “The will to be home for the holidays outweighed everything else.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_011">Joel Roberts, “Christmas After Katrina,” <em class="emphasis">CBS Evening News</em>, December 25, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/25/eveningnews/main1165360.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/25/eveningnews/main1165360.shtml</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> By this time, they were motivated by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social needs</a><span class="glossdef">Bonds or attachments to other people and feelings of love and belonging.</span></span>, or the need to belong and have an attachment or bond to others.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_012"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p05">Slowly but surely, people began to rebuild their lives and their cities. People took on leadership roles and began to take recovery to the next level. Even people who were hundreds of miles away from the hurricane-ravaged area wanted to help. Volunteers from all over the country began to make the pilgrimage to the Gulf Coast to help in any way they could. In fact, volunteer vacations to help rebuild cities such as New Orleans became commonplace and are still going on today.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_013">Sheryl Kane, “Volunteer Vacations: Rebuilding New Orleans,” June 26, 2009, SingleMindedWomen, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://singlemindedwomen.com/2009/06/rebuilding-new-orleans">http://singlemindedwomen.com/2009/06/rebuilding-new-orleans</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> This is an example of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">esteem needs</a><span class="glossdef">Feelings of being respected and appreciated by one’s peers.</span></span>, or the need to feel respected and appreciated by one’s peers.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p08">This all comes together at the point of sale, whether you are selling in business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) environments. When you understand the motivation of your customer, you can customize your solution and your message to meet their needs, emotions, and motivations. Consider the Hurricane Katrina example; would you attempt to sell fine jewelry, pitch the benefits of a landscaping service, or suggest a home theater system to someone in New Orleans on August 29, 2005? Probably not. People were focused on their most basic needs at that time, and none of these products or services would have been appropriate to sell. Although this may seem like an extreme example, it’s a good way to remember to look at the world through your customer’s eyes, as you’ll see a completely different view. Now that you can see what motivates people to buy, it’s time to learn who is buying. Although the buying process is similar for B2C and B2B, there are some distinct differences that can make a difference in the way you sell.</p>

You might be shopping for yourself or buying a gift for a family member or a friend.

So, whether you are buying a cell phone and service at a Verizon store, a music download from iTunes, or a burger and fries at Burger King, you are buying in the B2C arena. Even though you may behave differently than your brother or roommate in terms of your purchasing decisions, you are all described as B2C customers because you are the ultimate consumer of the products or services you buy.</p>

Facebook, SecondLife.com, and Stardolls.com are just a few Web sites that give users the option to buy virtual goods. Why do people buy things that aren’t even real? For some of the same reasons people buy the real thing: to be able to do more (i.e., increase functionality), build relationships, and establish identity.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_017">Jeremy Liew, “Why Do People Buy Virtual Goods?” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, February 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123395867963658435.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123395867963658435.html</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s06_p01">B2C and B2B purchasers are different for several reasons. The most important differentiator is that consumers purchase for their own consumption (or the consumption of their household or friends), whereas B2B customers purchase to produce or resell the product to a company or the ultimate consumer. There are also several other key differences between B2C and B2B buyers. Generally, B2C buying is based—for the most part—on impulse, low-risk decisions for products and services that are readily accessible. Whether you shop online, in a store, or at a direct selling party, your buying decisions impact only yourself and your family and do not put you at risk. Although you may make some significant buying decisions such as a house or a car, your options are easily accessible (go online, go to the mall or store), and your decisions don’t put you in danger of losing anything—except, of course, if you spend money you don’t have.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s06_s02_p01">If you think it’s difficult to keep everyone in your apartment happy with the food purchases you make at the supermarket, that’s easy compared to the number of people involved in a B2B purchasing decision. In most B2B transactions, there are multiple decision makers involved in each purchase. Think about your trip to the supermarket from the B2B buyer’s perspective. The decision about which products to stock on the shelves was ultimately made by someone who holds the title of “buyer” in the company. However, she could not decide unilaterally what to carry in the bottled water section. She has to understand which bottled water her customers want, consult with the general merchandise manager, who is responsible for the shelf space, and the vice president of merchandising, who oversees all product choices. She may even need to make a presentation to a buying committee before she makes the decision to carry another flavor of Vitaminwater. She will need to get approval for the money to invest in the inventory and shelf space. Depending on the organization and the size and impact of the decision, several people from several different departments may be involved in a B2B buying decision.</p>

He may compare the offerings from competitive companies, do a competitive cost analysis, and even conduct a cost-benefit analysis to determine which product will provide the most benefit for the least amount of cost. He might have a preference of which vendor to choose as a result of this information and his knowledge of the different companies in the industry. His influence may be quite significant as to what choice the company makes for the purchase. There may be other people in the organization who are also influencers, such as the IT manager, customer service manager, and others.</p>

Decision makers could be anyone who holds the responsibility or accountability for making buying decisions for the company. In the case of the e-mail and social networking technology purchase, depending on the company, the decision maker might be the CEO, the head of the marketing department, or even a committee of people from marketing, IT, and customer service. A smart decision maker involves the users and influencers in her decision-making process to make the best choice. An investment in technology will not only be expensive, but will last for years; once a company makes a commitment to integrate their systems with a technology company, it is not practical to make frequent changes. The decision making process in B2B can take days, weeks, months, or even years to make, depending on the company and the product or service being purchased.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s07_s04_p01">When you are selling in a B2B environment, you may not always have access to the ultimate decision maker. But building a relationship with the initiator, influencers, and users can be just as important and effective as meeting with the decision maker. However, you should always be aware of the “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">power level</a><span class="glossdef">The level in a company or organization at which the buying decision is made.</span></span>,” or exactly the level in the organization that is making the buying decision. Sometimes, salespeople don’t get to the power level, but instead stop at one or two levels below that critical level where the purchasing decision is being made. If the vice president of human resources is making the decision as to which vendor to choose for the company’s training programs, it’s important to build a relationship with her. Having a relationship with the director of training is critical, but a successful salesperson wouldn’t stop there; he would work to secure a relationship at the power level, which is the vice president. This video discusses the power level and its importance to success in selling.</p>

Usually, straight rebuys are consumable products or supplies such as office supplies, maintenance supplies, or parts. This is an opportunity for you to shine, whether the customer is currently purchasing from you or not. When purchases are on “auto pilot,” sometimes the salesperson gets lazy, takes the business for granted, and doesn’t go the extra mile to suggest something new or better. If a prospective customer is already buying from someone else, you have the opportunity to win her over by suggesting a better or more efficient product, a different pack size or method of replenishment, or other ideas that will help the customer save time or money or increase quality. For straight rebuys, it is often price that gets the customer’s attention, but it is service (or lack of it) that makes the customer switch providers.</p>

The buyer realizes there is a need for the product or service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_044">Ron Brauner, “B2B Buying Process: 8 Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> In the B2B environment, this might occur because of an internal need (e.g., the company needs more office space) or because of a customer need (e.g., green tea is becoming more popular, and so we want to offer it on our menu). This is the ideal opportunity for you to learn about your customers’ needs, although it may be difficult to know exactly when a customer or prospective customer is beginning this step. That’s why it’s important to engage your customer in dialogue to understand their current and future needs. Sometimes, you can help your customer see an opportunity that he didn’t realize.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s01_p03">2. <strong class="emphasis bold">Defining the need</strong>. This step usually involves users as well as initiators to put more definition around the type of product or service that will help meet the need.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_045">Ron Brauner, “B2B Buying Process: 8 Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> For example, in the case of office space, the head of facilities would ask the head of human resources about the types of new positions that will be needed and the type of workspace each requires. He might also ask for insight from each hiring manager or department head in the company, such as the head of operations, marketing, finance, and other areas. This will help him more fully understand the general type of product or service that is needed. Salespeople can play a role in this step of the buying process by sharing information and insights from other customers, without divulging any confidential information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s01_p04">3. <strong class="emphasis bold">Developing the specifications</strong>. This is the step at which the exact needs are outlined.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_046">Barton A. Weitz, Stephen B. Castleberry, and John F. Tanner, Jr., <em class="emphasis">Selling: Building Partnerships</em>, 7th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2009), 93.</span> For example, if Target identified the need to create its own brand of DVD player, the appropriate people in the company would determine the exact specifications of the product: what functions it will have, how large it will be, what materials it will be made of, how many colors will be offered, and all other attributes of the product. When a salesperson has a good relationship with a customer, the buyer might ask the salesperson for insights and advice on different features, functionality, and production costs to finalize the product or service specifications.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s01_p05">4. <strong class="emphasis bold">Searching for appropriate suppliers</strong>. This step is focused on researching potential suppliers. This research can be conducted online by doing a Google search for suppliers of the desired product or service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_047">Ron Brauner, “B2B Buying Process: 8 Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> Trade associations are also an excellent source as many provide unbiased evaluations of suppliers; for example, Forrester Research publishes a report on Web site analytic tools.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s01_p08">5. <strong class="emphasis bold">Requesting proposals</strong>. This is when the buyer or buying center develops a formal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">request for proposal</a><span class="glossdef">A formal request from possible suppliers to provide or create a specific product or service.</span></span>, often called an RFP, and she identifies several potential vendors that could produce the product or service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_048">Ron Brauner, “B2B Buying Process: 8 Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> For example, if Home Depot decided that it wanted to upgrade its bags, the buyer would have determined the specification, quantity, shipping points, usage, and other requirements (e.g., being environmentally friendly), and put the information into a formal document that is sent to several bag manufacturers along with questions about the history of the company, key customers, locations, manufacturing capacity, turnaround time, and other relevant information. Each manufacturer would have the opportunity to respond to the RFP with a formal <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">proposal</a><span class="glossdef">A written document that outlines a company’s capabilities, delivery, and pricing in relation to a specific product or service.</span></span>, which means that each company would provide information about their company, capabilities, delivery, and pricing to manufacture the bags.

After the proposals are submitted, the buyer or buying center reviews each one and determines whether the company would be a good fit for the project. At this point, the number of potential vendor choices is narrowed to a select few. Usually, salespeople from each of the chosen companies are invited to meet with the buyer or buying center to discuss the proposal, capabilities, and pricing. Negotiation for pricing, quality, timing, service, and other attributes may also take place during this step.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_049">Ron Brauner, “B2B Buying Process: 8 Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> This is the step where a salesperson may need to overcome objections, or the reasons why the customer may not want to choose her as the company of choice.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_050">Ron Brauner, “B2B Buying Process: 8 Stages of the Business Sales Funnel,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68">http://www.ronbrauner.com/?p=68</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span></p>

The buyer or buying center chooses one (or the necessary number) of companies to execute the project, finalizes details, negotiates all aspects of the arrangement, and signs a contract. This step requires perseverance and attention to detail on the part of the salesperson. Once the decision is made, the real business of selling begins: delivering the product or service as agreed upon and building the relationship.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s01_p12">8. <strong class="emphasis bold">Postpurchase evaluation</strong>. Throughout the buying process, the buyer is provided all the good news: how the new product or service will solve her company’s problems, increase demand, reduce costs, or improve profitability. It is the postpurchase evaluation that tells the tale. Did the product or service perform as promised? Was the delivery and installation done correctly and on time? Are the business results in line with expectations? Is the relationship growing? Do the salesperson and his company really care about the performance of the buyer’s company? Does the salesperson add value to the buyer’s company? This is where the rubber meets the road; it presents an opportunity for the salesperson to communicate, anticipate, and solve any problems that may have arisen.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_051">Michael R.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s02_p01">It used to be that B2B buyers relied on salespeople to get information, demonstrations, and cost about products and services. Salespeople sold, and buyers bought; the world was a simpler place.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s02_p02">Today, B2B buyers are doing the work of two or even three employees because there are fewer people working at companies due to cutbacks and restructuring. The fact is, buyers don’t have the time to meet with salespeople like they used to. And the Internet has been a game changer. Buyers can not only research product and supplier options online, but they can also see product specifications, view demonstration videos, participate in online forums, get real-time recommendations and feedback from users on social networks, and basically be smarter than any salesperson before he even calls for an appointment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_055">Geoffrey James, “Is Your Sales Process Obsolete?” BNET, March 30, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=30">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=30</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> The power has shifted from sellers to buyers. In fact, the Internet has had such a profound effect on how people make purchasing decisions that the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em> has coined a new term: “new info shopper.” These are people who can’t buy anything without getting information online first. What’s even more important to note is the fact that 92 percent of new info shoppers have more confidence in the information they get online than from an ad, salesperson, or other company source.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_056">Mark Penn, “New Info Shoppers,” January 8, 2009, <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123144483005365353.html?mod=dist_smartbrief#">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123144483005365353.html?mod=dist_smartbrief#</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s02_p03">So what’s a salesperson to do? Stop, listen, and help your customer make the best decision for her business, even if it means that she doesn’t buy your product. Despite the importance of the Internet in providing information throughout the buying process, B2B buyers still gather insight from a variety of sources that include salespeople. Successful salespeople are those that truly focus on the buyer’s needs, which may mean giving up the sale and bringing valuable feedback to your company to change the product, service, or other options that are reasons why customers might not buy from you. The new world order requires everyone to rethink the conventional wisdom. <em class="emphasis">Selling</em> used to be something you “do to” a customer; now it’s something you “do for” a customer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_057">Geoffrey James, “Is Your Sales Process Obsolete?” BNET, March 30, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=30">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=30</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> The salespeople who win are the ones who listen in person, on the phone, and online, then make the recommendation that is in the customer’s best interest.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s02_p04">Information is no longer the exclusive domain of the salesperson.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s03_p01">Whether you look at the traditional buying process or the role the Internet plays in providing information, it appears that the B2B buying process is logical and rational, but appearances can be deceiving. Despite the implication and belief that companies make purchasing decisions based on facts, it’s a good idea to remember one of the key tenets of B2B buying mentioned earlier: business-to-business means person-to-person. That means that although a B2B buyer is making a decision on behalf of her company, she still behaves like a consumer and is subject to emotions and feelings. “People rationalize buying decisions based on facts, but they make buying decisions based on feeling,” according to Bryan Eisenberg from ClickZ.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_062">Bryan Eisenberg, “Buying Is Not a Rational Decision,” ClickZ, November 26, 2001, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.clickz.com/927221">http://www.clickz.com/927221</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span></p>

People won’t buy from someone they don’t trust, which is why some salespeople are more successful than others; they work to establish and develop trust with the customer. People buy when they feel comfortable with the product and the salesperson and when they believe it is the best decision they can make. They want to do business with someone who understands all their needs, not just the needs of the product or service. And because the B2B purchasing process usually includes multiple people, it means that the salesperson needs to develop a relationship and establish trust with as many people involved in the purchasing process as possible.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s03_s01_p02">Although trust is a positive emotion that can influence a sale, an even stronger emotion in B2B buying is fear. B2B buyers have several fears, not the least of which is being taken for a fool. Many executives have had the experience of being told one thing by a salesperson only to learn the hard way that what he said just wasn’t true. “People are afraid of being sold,” according to Tom Hopkins, author of <em class="emphasis">How to Master the Art of Selling</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_063">“Fear of Buying,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, August 18, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=296">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=296</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> The best way to overcome this fear is to demonstrate that you are trustworthy. That means something as simple as returning a phone call when you say you will, or following up with information as promised. Even the language that you use can signal trust. For example, “initial investment” is a better term than “down payment,” “fee” is more customer-friendly than “commission,” “agreement” says something different than “contract,” and “can’t” sounds more negative than “would you consider.” Understand your customer’s fear of buying and replace it with comfort, trust, and confidence—in you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_064">“Fear of Buying,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, August 18, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=296">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=296</a> (accessed June 21, 2010).</span></p>

But he realized that <em class="emphasis">she</em> was afraid of a fire so instead of simply saying that he was not concerned, he took the opportunity to address and respect her fear, not gloss over it. He responded by saying, “Yes, certainly, I’ve thought about the danger of a fire, and let me show you what we’ve done about it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_065">Norm Brodsky, “Listen and Earn,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, March 1, 1997, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19980301/878.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19980301/878.html</a> (accessed August 9, 2009).</span> He used the opportunity to put her fear to rest, even before his sales presentation.</p>

Most salespeople address the organizational risk by discussing the rational aspects of the product or service with information such as, “This server accommodates more than five times as much traffic as your current server.” However, it is the personal risk, which is usually not articulated, that has a significant impact on the buying decision. This is especially true today given the focus on personal accountability, budgets, and performance. Imagine being the buyer at a fashion boutique that bought too many plaid skirts and has to request a budget for markdowns, or the decision maker who bought the computer system to power the United States’ government car rebate program, Cash for Clunkers, which was delayed for over three weeks because the system crashed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_069">“Cash for Clunkers Launch Postponed Due to Computer Crash,” <em class="emphasis">U.S. News and World Report</em>, July 24, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/090724-Breaking-News-Cash-for-Clunkers-Launch-Postponed-by-Computer-Crash">http://usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/cars-trucks/daily-news/090724-Breaking-News-Cash-for-Clunkers-Launch-Postponed-by-Computer-Crash</a> (accessed August 4, 2009).</span> Some purchasing decisions at certain companies have been so bad that people have been fired as a result. Every B2B purchaser thinks about nightmares like this, so she is naturally risk-averse. The best approach in these instances is for the salesperson to reassure her that you realize how important it is for her to look good to her boss and throughout her organization as a result of the decision and show her exactly how you will help her do that.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_070">“Fear of Buying,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, August 18, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=296">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=296</a> (accessed June 21, 2010).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Evolving Buying and Selling Processes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s04_p01">The framework for the buying and selling processes has been in place for many years. The buying process changes literally every day and has dramatic impact on the selling process. As a result, the “new” processes are not yet clearly defined. One thing is for certain; the processes are no longer organized, controllable functions. “Linear is so twentieth century,” according to Michael R. Solomon, author of <em class="emphasis">Consumerspace: Conquering Marketing Strategies for a Branded World</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_073">Michael R. Solomon, <em class="emphasis">Conquering Consumerspace: Marketing Strategies for a Branded World</em> (New York: AMACOM, 2003), 11.</span> Cultural, social, and technological changes will continue to drive companies for even better performance, faster, and with ideas as currency, which will continue to drive change in the buying process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s04_p02">To understand the impact of the rapid changes occurring in the buying process, it’s important to know the basic steps in the selling process. The next seven chapters review the selling process in detail and include insights into how the process is changing. A study by William Moncrief and Greg W. Marshall provides a roadmap for the evolution of the selling process in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s04_t01">Table 6.2 "The Evolution of the Seven Steps of Selling"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_p01">No matter how the buying process evolves, customers continue to make purchase decisions driven by emotions. You learned how motivating trust and fear are for people who are making B2B buying decisions. Comfort, vanity, convenience, pleasure, desire to succeed, security, prevention of loss, and need to belong are all emotions that motivate purchases. A company may want to build a new building that carries its brand name downtown to signal its importance to the city and business community; that would be an example of vanity as a motivator. Or perhaps the company wants to move its headquarters to a better part of town to provide better security for its employees. Maybe a prominent figure in the community donates a large sum of money to your college motivated by the desire to give back. The same types of motivations apply to B2C purchases: a woman purchases makeup in the hopes of looking as beautiful as the model in the ads, a man buys a sports car in the hopes of turning heads, a student buys a microwave for the convenience of having food when she wants it.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_p09">Notice how Amazon skillfully reinforces the benefit of portability by showing someone reading on a beach or a bus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_p10">Why does FAB work? Because customers want to know what a product or service will do for them—not just what it’s made of. B2C and B2B customers seek information before making a buying decision but are also driven by emotions. FAB helps you appeal to a customer’s rational and emotional buying behavior by providing the most compelling features and factual information and then showing how the features provide an advantage that delivers a benefit. This is how salespeople help customers establish an emotional connection with a product. You remember from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a> the power of an emotional connection between a customer and a brand.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_p11">You probably use FAB sometimes without even realizing it. “My new Lucky Brand jeans have a dirty wash, fit great, and make me look thin. The best part is they were on sale for only $89.00.” The features are the dirty wash and the fact that they were on sale for $89.00; the advantage is that they fit well (no easy feat when it comes to jeans); the benefit is that they make you feel like you look thin and, as a result, make you feel good when you wear them. Your statement is much more powerful when you frame it with FAB than if you simply say, “I got some new jeans today for $89.00.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_p12">Or maybe you stopped into McDonald’s and tried one of their new Angus Third Pounders. The product feature is that the burger is one-third of a pound and is available in three flavor options; the advantage is that it is thick and juicy; the benefit is that you will enjoy the taste and your hunger is satisfied. The FAB message is more compelling than simply saying that you had a hamburger that was one-third of a pound; that would be stopping at the feature and not offering an advantage or benefit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_p13">If you want to be able to use FAB in conversation, simply think in terms of the following:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_s01_p01">Now that you know what FAB is, you probably want to know how to use it most effectively in selling. Here are three easy steps to put FAB to work for you:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s02_s05_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Know your customer</strong>. Benefits speak emotionally to customers in a way that rational facts can’t. But you need to know what is important to each customer. The health club that’s open twenty-four hours might be attractive to a young professional because he can work out late in the evening after a long day, whereas the club’s day care center might be appealing to a young mother. Similarly, in a B2B selling situation in which a buyer is evaluating warehouse space, one customer might be interested in the warehouse because of its state-of-the-art systems, while another might be focused on location. Know what motivates your customer, and then you can craft an effective FAB statement.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_084">Laura Clampitt Douglas, “Marketing Features vs. Benefits,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/homeofficemagcom/2000/december/34942.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/homeofficemagcom/2000/december/34942.html</a> (accessed August 4, 2009).</span>
</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Think outside your box</strong>. If you want your FAB to work for your customer, you will need to deliver value in the form of benefits that she can’t get from anyone else. Think about your product or service in a different way; talk to people, watch the trends, see what else you can bring when you look at your product or service in a different way. Baking soda had traditionally been used as a leavening agent for baking. Arm &amp; Hammer reinvented baking soda as a way to remove odors from refrigerators. Can you be as creative with the application for your product or service?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_085">Laura Clampitt Douglas, “Marketing Features vs. Benefits,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/homeofficemagcom/2000/december/34942.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/magazine/homeofficemagcom/2000/december/34942.html</a> (accessed August 4, 2009).</span>
</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get in touch with your customer’s motivation</strong>. Listen, learn, and craft an FAB message that will “have your customer at hello.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_086">IMDB, <em class="emphasis">Jerry McGuire</em>, written and directed by Cameron Crowe, released December 13, 1996, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695</a> (accessed August 4, 2009).</span> Although that might be an overly romantic notion of how selling works, your goal is to have your customer fall in love with your product or service so much that it’s something he can’t live without. Imagine living without iTunes, your cell phone, or your favorite pair of jeans. That’s how your customer should feel about the product or service you are selling. If you understand his motivation, you can deliver features, advantages, and benefits that not only tell him why he should buy, but why he can’t afford not to.</li>

                    <li>The traditional B2B buying process has seven steps: need recognition, defining the need, developing the specifications, searching for appropriate suppliers, evaluating proposals, making the buying decision, and postpurchase evaluation.</li>
                    <li>The Internet is a game-changer as it relates to the buying process because information is no longer the exclusive domain of the salesperson; the power has shifted from the seller to the buyer.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Crowdsourcing</strong> occurs when a company takes a job that is traditionally done by an employee and issues an “open call,” usually online, to people all over the world to solve the problem. Salespeople can use <strong class="emphasis bold">crowdsourcing</strong> to get the best solutions for their customers.</li>
                    <li>Emotions such as comfort, security, convenience, pleasure, and vanity are major motivations for buying decisions.</li>
                    <li>Trust and fear are especially important in B2B buying because the decision maker has to consider <strong class="emphasis bold">organizational risk</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">personal risk</strong> as part of his buying decision.</li>
                    <li>The buying process continues to evolve, which changes the selling process; the traditional selling process provides a foundation and insight into the evolution.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_p02">You’ve already done a lot of work that will serve you well as you network and interview—you’ve identified your brand positioning points in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>, put them to work in your résumé and cover letter in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a>, and developed your elevator pitch in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch05#fwk-125752-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Power of Effective Communication"</a>. All these activities help you bring your personal FAB (feature, advantage, benefit) message into focus. Your FAB message will help you tell the details about your brand and will help you tell your “stories” about your experience and accomplishments during your interviews.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Class projects</strong>. Choose those projects that demonstrate your skills, especially in your major. For example, if you did a sales presentation, include a video clip along with your selling aids. Or if you created a PR plan, include the plan along with the exhibits. Group projects are acceptable as long as the group names are included on the title page. A team project allows you to talk about how you provided leadership to the team or helped the team get focused.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Internship projects</strong>. If you had an internship or multiple internships, include samples of the projects on which you worked. For example, include copies of Web pages, brochures, flyers, graphs, presentations, or other samples of your work.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Volunteer projects</strong>. If you have been involved in a student group, community service, or other service organization, include samples of the projects on which you worked. For example, if your group did a fundraiser for breast cancer, include the flyer for the event along with photos and a summary of the contributions.</li>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s02_p04">Whenever you work on a class project, internship, volunteer project, or any other type of project that demonstrates your skills, keep a copy for your portfolio. The same is true when you begin working; keep copies of all your projects to continue to build your portfolio throughout your career. You never know when you will need to show samples of your work. It’s best to avoid including any confidential or proprietary information from companies or organizations.</p>
        </div>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s02_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other work samples</strong>. If you enjoy photography, writing, design, selling on eBay, or other activity that has application to the position for which you are seeking, include that work. In other words, print the Web page for your eBay store along with the feedback you have received, include photographs or other projects on which you have worked to show your work. If you don’t have samples of your work for your portfolio, consider starting a blog and print copies of your entries.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Letters of recommendation</strong>. Ask for a letter of recommendation from former supervisors, colleagues, team leaders, professors, and other people who will be happy to write a letter about your skills.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_089">Maureen Crawford Hentz, “How to Obtain and Use References and Recommendation Letters,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/references_recommendation_letters.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/references_recommendation_letters.html</a> (accessed August 5, 2009)</span> If you have had a summer job or internship, ask your former boss and other people with whom you worked to write a letter of recommendation. Keep the copies of the letters in your portfolio and show them to prospective employers during your interview. Although these letters are different from references, they serve the purpose of <em class="emphasis">showing</em> your prospective employer how highly people regard you and your work. You will be asked for references after the interview process if you are one of the final candidates. See the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch04#fwk-125752-ch04">Chapter 4 "Business Ethics: The Power of Doing the Right Thing"</a> for more information about how to contact and submit references, including how letter of recommendation from references can help set you apart.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_p01">After you gather all of your work samples, here are a few tips that will help you organize them for an effective visual story.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Choose a few work samples</strong>. Select samples (no more than five or six) that reflect your brand positioning points. If leadership is important, be sure to include projects, results, pictures, and other visual elements that will demonstrate your leadership story.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create a summary page for each work sample</strong>. Include bullet points for the project name, objective, approach or strategy, and results. A sample is provided in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_f01">Figure 6.13 "Sample Summary Page"</a>.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use clean copies, in color where appropriate</strong>. Avoid using papers that include comments or grades. Use fresh, clean copies of all samples. If you need to make a copy of an original document that was in color, splurge and pay for color copies; it’s worth it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Include extra copies of your résumé</strong>. Your portfolio is a great place to keep at least three or four extra copies of your most current résumé printed on twenty-four-pound paper. Although your interviewer may have already received your résumé before the interview, he may not have it handy when you come in. Or you may be asked to meet with some people that were not on the original interview schedule. If this is the case, you can be the consummate professional and offer your interviewer a reference copy of your résumé. It’s also the perfect time to mention your portfolio.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use a professional binder or portfolio</strong>. Visit a local or online art supply or office supply store and get a professional three-ring binder or portfolio. You can include your work samples in plastic sleeves, but it is not required. Many portfolios include plastic sleeves for your samples. Ask if the store offers a student discount.</li>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s03_p02">As you develop your FAB and portfolio, think about the stories you want to tell about each one. Stories are much more powerful than facts. For example, “I can really appreciate what it takes to go the extra mile for a customer. When I worked at J&amp;J Catering, they needed someone to mix the giant vats of cookie dough. Needless to say, I spent hours working with the dough, but I wanted to make it interesting, so I learned how ingredients work together, and I created a new recipe for lemon cookies that became the signature dessert of the company.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s04_p01">A portfolio is a must to bring on a job interview. You might be wondering if it’s a good idea to also create an online portfolio. The answer is “yes.” Creating your own professional Web site as a way to showcase your résumé, samples of your work, awards, and letter of recommendation is a perfect way to build your brand and demonstrate to your prospective employer that you have additional technology skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s04_p02">Your online portfolio, or Web site, should include all the elements that are included in your offline portfolio. Since space is not an issue, you may want to include even more samples of your work, especially if you have writing or design samples. This is also an ideal place to include a link to your blog.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s03_s04_p03">A word of caution: Your professional Web site should be exactly that—professional. That means no personal photos, comments, or casual blog posts from friends. In other words, your Facebook page is not an appropriate place for your professional Web site. Use a business-like domain name (http://www.yourname.com); if you don’t already have one, you can get one at Google or GoDaddy.com, for a minimal annual fee.
