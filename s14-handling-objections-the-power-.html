    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_p01">You’ve been working really hard at school, and it’s paying off. You’re doing well this semester with a GPA right where you want it. Spring break is right around the corner, and you and your friends have been talking about going to Mexico. You even had an impromptu “fiesta party” at your place and even do some research about airfares and hotels; there are some great deals out there. You present your case to your parents and end with a strong “close” to seal the deal: “The timing is perfect since it’s my senior year. I can book the flights tonight online.” You thought you sold them on the trip when they say, “We’re worried about you going out of the country without a chaperone.” You are deflated, but you won’t take no for an answer so you wait for a moment, let it sink in, then deliver your response, just like you planned. You have just experienced the fine art of overcoming objections.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_p02">Since you are constantly selling in your everyday life, you have also undoubtedly encountered objections: your friend doesn’t want to see the same movie as you, your brother doesn’t want to share the car, your parents want you home earlier than you would like. When you attempt to convince someone or “sell” him on your point of view, you are not always successful. But each time you “sell” your idea, you usually have additional information or a fallback position so that you can get what you want while meeting the other person’s needs. You are probably more skilled in overcoming objections than you realize.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_p03">Occasionally in your sales career, you will encounter a situation in which you are able to close the sale directly after giving your sales presentation. Such a situation, however, is the <em class="emphasis">exception</em> not the <em class="emphasis">rule</em>. Objections are simply a natural outcome of the sales process. Each potential prospect has his own set of unique needs, and, though you may identify most of them during the preapproach stage of the selling process when you do your research, you will not be able to anticipate all of them. After all, you are not a mind reader. Besides, if all it took to excel in sales was to deliver a perfect script, anyone could do it. But that is not the case. The essence of sales is handling objections and truly understanding how you can help your prospect meet her needs. It is a demonstration of your skills as a salesperson to find the opportunity in these objections, listen to your prospect, and then respond. So an objection is simply a question from a prospect that indicates that she wants more information. If she weren’t interested, she wouldn’t be asking questions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_001">John Boe, “Overcome Objections and Close the Sale,” Agency Sales, September 27, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.johnboe.com/articles/close_the_sale.html">http://www.johnboe.com/articles/close_the_sale.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_p04">The first myth to dispel is the assumption that objections are <em class="emphasis">bad</em> or an omen foreshadowing failure. On the contrary, resistance usually portends commitment. If a prospect is asking you questions, you can at least assume that he is interested in your product or service. In fact, in all likelihood, he already knows whether or not he needs or wants to make the purchase. Thus, the reason he is objecting isn’t necessarily because your presentation failed to communicate the features, advantages, and benefits of your offering. Rather, he is objecting because he is seeking reassurance; he is on the fence of indecision, and he wants you to provide him with the incentive that justifies an immediate purchase.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_002">R. T. Edwards, “Power Selling,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em> 38, no. 3 (March 1993): 13.</span> Supply your prospect with the right information, that is, show him why he wants to buy your product or service.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Are Objections?</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Objections</a><span class="glossdef">Prospect questions or hesitancies about a product or company.</span></span>, also called sales objections, are generally defined as prospect questions or hesitancies about either the product or company.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_003">William C. Moncrief and Greg W. Marshall, “The Evolution of the Seven Steps of Selling,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Marketing Management</em> 34, no. 1 (January 2005): 13–22.</span> While <em class="emphasis">objection</em> may sound like <em class="emphasis">rejection</em>, you should never assume that when a prospect asks a question or expresses a concern that you have failed to generate interest in your product or service. It is true sometimes that your prospect will object when he truly cannot or does not want to buy. Usually, though, objections mask—intentionally or unintentionally—a request for more information. They simply signal your prospect’s level of interest and alert you to what actions need to be taken to bring the sale to a close. If your prospect expresses objections, consider them invitations to continue to sell. Furthermore, leverage these objections into an opportunity to continue to build your relationship with your prospect so that you can continue to create a positive influence on the buyer’s decision. The fact is objections help you build your relationship and find the true reason for resistance. Think of objections as opportunities.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How Objections Build Relationships</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s02_p01">As an analogy, consider asking someone out on a date for the first time. Even if you have hooked him in with a great pick-up line (approach) and dazzled him with your sparkling personality (presentation), he may still not be convinced that you are serious about him. Naturally, he might respond by playing hard-to-get. How you react will reveal to him your level of commitment. By allowing the relationship to grow slowly and organically, you demonstrate your patience, sensitivity, and sincerity. You establish a foundation of trust that eventually wins him over. On the other hand, if you respond by getting huffy and stomping off, he will probably be glad to see you go.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Objections as Opportunities</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s03_p01">You might not keep track of objections in your everyday life (especially as they relate to dating). However, you may find it interesting to know that in sales, a prospect will say no an average of five times before he buys.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_004">John Boe, “Overcome Objections and Close the Sale,” Agency Sales, September 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.johnboe.com/articles/close_the_sale.html">http://www.johnboe.com/articles/close_the_sale.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> That means that it’s more likely than not that you will experience a prospect who poses at least one objection: asking a question, requesting more information or time, or pushing back due to financial constraints. Without objections, you would have no way of knowing what a prospect is thinking, what concerns she has, or what barriers might be in the way of her saying, “Where do I sign?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s03_p02">The fact is objections are an important part of the selling process. But thinking about <em class="emphasis">overcoming</em> objections might be the wrong frame of reference. The word “overcome” implies that you want to conquer, fight, or win (and, therefore, your prospect loses).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_005">Patty Morgan-Seager, “Handle Objections and Have Fun!” Multifamilypro, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smmonline.com/Articles_handleobj.htm">http://www.smmonline.com/Articles_handleobj.htm</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span> Instead, it’s best to think about objections as a perfect extension of the selling process. Think back to the steps of the selling process that you have covered so far: prospecting and qualifying, preapproach, approach, and presentation. Throughout each of these steps, your focus is on understanding your prospect’s needs and building a relationship based on trust. The same is true for this step: handling objections. This is all about learning more, finding common ground, and providing the solution that is best for your prospect. Objections and conversation help you better understand exactly what your prospect wants and needs. The bottom line is that you don’t want to avoid objections; you actually want to encourage objections and ask for them. According to the <em class="emphasis">Selling Power Sales Management Newsletter</em>, “Objections are not personal attacks; they’re gifts.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_006">“Hug Your Objections,” Selling Power Sales Management Newsletter, August 15, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=732">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=732</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s04_p01">If objections are such a positive part of the selling process, you might be wondering how to be prepared for them; how to think about them; how to consider them even before you get them.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Understand your prospect and believe in your partnership</strong>. If you did your homework at every step of the process so far and put together a presentation and proposal that really makes sense for your prospect’s business, you should be confident in the fact that you are a true business partner to your prospect.

Never lose sight of your prospect’s buying motivations. If time is mission-critical to his success, know what you can deliver and by when. If national reach is important to your prospect, be sure you address it in detail in your proposal.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Understand risk</strong>. Understand what your prospect considers a risk (e.g., time, money, changing suppliers). When risk outweighs reward in the mind of your prospect, chances are she will find a reason not to buy. Understand her risk factors and address them head on.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Anticipate objections</strong>. Think about every possible objection you might get—before you get it.

</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Raise objections first</strong>. Since you have done so much preparation and you understand and have a good relationship with your prospect, be proactive and be prepared to raise objections first. When you raise an objection, you actually turn it into a discussion point rather than an objection. It shows your prospect that you are thinking about the sale from her perspective and helps you build the relationship.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_013">Janaé Rubin, “Overcoming Objections” <em class="emphasis">Folio</em>, November 2005, 80–81.</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s04_p02">Objections should not intimidate you or dissuade you from continuing the selling process. Rather, you should consider objections opportunities to learn more about your prospect’s needs. The more you understand about your prospect’s needs, the greater your ability to determine how your product or service can satisfy them or how your product or service <em class="emphasis">can be improved</em> to satisfy them. Remember, selling is about solving problems. The solution that you offer will demonstrate to your prospect whether or not you truly understand his needs and whether or not you have his best interests at heart. By embracing your prospect’s objections and handling them effectively, you will inspire his trust, confidence, and most important, loyalty. As a result, both you and the prospect benefit.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s05_p01">While prospects may voice their objections in different ways, just about every objection comes down to one of four reasons: no or not enough money, no perceived need, no sense of urgency, and no trust.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_015">John Boe, “Overcome Objections and Close the Sale,” Agency Sales, September 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.johnboe.com/articles/close_the_sale.html">http://www.johnboe.com/articles/close_the_sale.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> As a selling professional, you have control over each one of these objections. But it’s too late if you address it only when the prospect objects. In other words, you are actually handling objections at every step of the selling process. For example, you can avoid the price objection with thorough qualification during your first step of the selling process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_016">Joan Leotta, “Overcoming Doubts: The Road to a Sale Is Blocked by the Prospect’s Doubts,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 20, no. 2, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5351">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5351</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s05_p02">If a prospect does not have a perceived need or high sense of urgency to buy your product or service, your challenge is to understand the drivers of his business. Every business has challenges, and your role from the time you qualify the prospect is to understand your prospect’s “pain points,” those issues that cause problems for him and his company and present barriers to growth. If you truly understand your prospect’s business, it is much easier to present a solution that addresses the perceived need and reasons to buy it now. “There is no reason for buyers to buy today unless we build in that sense of urgency and give them a reason to buy today,” says Dana Forest, director of sales at Simons Homes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_017">William F. Kendy, “An Uncertain Situation: How to Kick-Start the Hesitant Buyer,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 27, no. 9, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=7658">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=7658</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s05_p03">Many objections are raised because the relationship between the prospect and the salesperson is not fully developed. business-to-business (B2B) selling is dependent on trust. If the trust is not there, or the relationship is not yet fully developed, it can be difficult for a prospect to make a change or finalize the purchase. If this is the case, prospects will frequently delay or stall before making a decision, which can be an attempt to derail the sale.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">When Prospects Object</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s06_p01">While you may not be able to predict your prospect’s every objection, you can at least predict that <em class="emphasis">he will object</em>. Knowing when to expect objections is the first step to handling them: you will eliminate the chance of appearing caught off guard or unprepared to discuss the product or service that you are selling.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s06_p02">Of course, it is possible that the prospect may object at any time during your sales call—from introduction to close. Still, there are specific points in time during the sales process where these objections are more likely to occur: when you are first trying to make contact, when you are making a sales presentation, and when you are attempting to close the sale, or make a trial close. As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch10#fwk-125752-ch10">Chapter 10 "The Presentation: The Power of Solving Problems"</a>, a trial close includes any attempt to close the sale but usually focuses on asking the prospect’s opinion: “What do you think about the turnaround time?” A trial close may occur at any point during the selling process. In other words, if the prospect indicates that she may be interested in making the purchase, it is an opportunity to make a trial close.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s06_p03">Objections are likely to occur at several points during the selling process, including the trial close. It’s best to be prepared for objections at every step in the selling process, including the qualifying stage. Know your prospect and be ready to incorporate objections into your sales presentation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_018">Jeffrey Gitomer, “Objection Prevention &amp; Objection Cure,” video, May 18, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgfmcuE_06w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgfmcuE_06w</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>

It is unlikely that your prospect will wait until you have finished your presentation before asking you questions. However, the experienced salesperson will actually encourage questions throughout her presentation since she knows that responding to them supplies her with precious time that she can use to further demonstrate how her offering can solve her prospect’s problem. As a rule, you will want to acknowledge objections as they arise. If you feel that the objection will be addressed at a later point during the presentation, you may postpone your response, but you will need to communicate this information to your prospect. For example, you might say something like the following:</p>

Always remember that an unacknowledged concern lessens the opportunity for a sale. Responding means fully listening to your prospect’s concerns and objections, asking clarifying questions to determine whether or not you understand them, identifying the types of objections they are, and meeting them. To be clear, “meeting” an objection does not mean saying what you think the prospect wants to hear; you should never make a promise about a product or service that you cannot deliver. How you <em class="emphasis">meet</em> an objection will depend on the type of objection you are dealing with. Simply put, meeting the objection means returning to the presentation stage, elaborating on your product’s capabilities, and emphasizing in what ways they benefit your prospect. For example, assume you are making a sales presentation for a software product to a B2B client and she presents an objection about the timing of the installation.</p>

If you determine that your prospect has new objections, then you will want to repeat the response process. You may have to use a trial close several times before moving to a close. Keep in mind that the sales process is not perfectly linear; rather, it is iterative. Depending on the prospect and the product, it is perfectly appropriate to repeat steps.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s01_s06_s03_p10">In the same way, you should never allow yourself to become defensive or antagonistic when a prospect makes an objection. Since your goal is to build and sustain an enduring customer relationship, you will want to handle your prospect’s objections with as much delicacy as possible. For example, avoid responding to objections with statements beginning with “but”: “But our company is better” or “But we offer more value for your money.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_021">Keith Rosen, “Respond to your Prospect’s Objections,” AllBusiness, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-active-listening/4019422-1.html">http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-active-listening/4019422-1.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> It’s better to respond in a positive way, such as “We are the only company that offers a guarantee on our product.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p01">Learning how to handle objections is key, especially when many of the same ones occur regularly. There are six strategies that can help you handle virtually any objection.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p11">1.<strong class="emphasis bold"> View the objection as a question</strong>. Many times salespeople hear an objection as a personal attack. Instead, an objection such as “Why are your prices so high?” should be considered a question. That allows a more positive conversation rather than a defensive one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_022">Pam Lontos, “10 Strategies for Dealing with Objections,” FrogPond, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12">http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p12">2.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Respond to the objection with a question</strong>. As in every step of the selling process, asking the right questions is critical, and handling objections is no exception. Questions, such as “Can you share you concerns in this area?” or “Is there another way to look at this to make it work for you?” are good ways to engage prospects in dialogue that will help you better solve their problems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_023">Keith Rosen, “Respond to your Prospect’s Objections,” AllBusiness, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-active-listening/4019422-1.html">http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-active-listening/4019422-1.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p13">3.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Restate the objection before answering the objection</strong>. It’s a good idea to check for understanding and demonstrate that you are listening by restating your prospect’s objection. For example, “So what you’re saying is you’re concerned about the capacity during peak periods” is a good way not only to acknowledge the objection but also to give you time to formulate your response.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_024">Pam Lontos, “10 Strategies for Dealing with Objections,” FrogPond, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12">http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p14">4.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Take a pause before responding</strong>. Many times salespeople “oversell” when they are answering an objection. When a prospect raises an objection, stop, listen, and pause for a few seconds. This shows the prospect that you are legitimately listening to her objection, not just trying to sell.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_025">Felice Philip Verrecchia, “How to Identify and Overcome Objections,” Edward Lowe Peerspectives, August 11, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf">http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p15">5.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Use testimonials and past experiences</strong>. Don’t avoid answering any part of an objection. In fact, objections are the perfect time to share testimonials. For example, “I have another customer who was concerned about the turnaround time. He found that not only were we able to deliver on time, we were slightly under budget.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_026">Felice Philip Verrecchia, “How to Identify and Overcome Objections,” Edward Lowe Peerspectives, August 11, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf">http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>

Listening is an important skill to use, especially when a prospect voices a product objection.

Bob Ladner, founder and president of a market research firm in Florida, wanted to compete with the big players but couldn’t get any prospects to give him a chance. Finally, in the middle of a sales presentation when he was overcoming objection after objection, he asked the prospect, “What do you want? A guarantee?” While it’s almost impossible to offer a guarantee in the market research business, Ladner ultimately designed one that works. His successful firm now boasts major clients thanks to the guarantee. “The guarantee is a method of generating confidence,” says Ladner.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_031">Leslie M.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Price Objection</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p01">One of the most common objections is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price objection</a><span class="glossdef">A concern voiced by the prospect about the perceived value of a product or service.</span></span>. It is important to ask probing questions to really understand the nature of this objection. Many prospects use the price objection as a negotiating ploy to determine how much flexibility there is in the pricing, while others use it as a way to object due to budget constraints. It’s best to always be prepared for the price objection. The bottom line on the price objection is that people buy when they see the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value</a><span class="glossdef">The worth that a product or service provides to a customer.</span></span>. Cost (or price) is what the customer actually pays for the product or service. Value is the benefit that the customer receives from the product or service. It is value that customers assign to a product or service that determines the price. For example, value is what dictates that a shack on the beach in Monterey, California, is worth more than a similar home in Omaha, Nebraska. Or in another example, value is what causes customers to pay more for an iPod than a comparable MP3 player. Customers perceive that the design and function of an iPod delivers more value, even at a higher price, than comparable products made by other manufacturers. This is the essence of value.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p02">“The customer is typically going to throw the price objection out there just out of habit, out of rote,” according to sales trainer Chuck Reeves. When salespeople really listen to customers, Reeves says that they actually hear customers saying, “I don’t see the value, and if you can convince me there is value, there is return, then I just might pay.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_033">Rick Weber, “How to Overcome the Price Objection,” Trailer/Body Builders, January 1, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://trailer-bodybuilders.com/mag/trucks_overcome_price_objection">http://trailer-bodybuilders.com/mag/trucks_overcome_price_objection</a> (accessed November 7, 2009).</span> Even when budgets are tight, companies make adjustments to purchase the products or services that they find compelling and can help them profitably grow their business. If you think about it, the same is probably true for your personal purchasing; when you want something bad enough, you are able to somehow find the money for it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p03">Many salespeople believe that price is the barrier standing in the way of making a sale. That is, they think that cutting the price will help them get the sale. Many times salespeople are willing to cut the price or a product or service when a prospect objects because they feel that if the product or service is priced lower, they will get the sale. This situation is sometimes compounded if the salesperson rationalizes cutting the prices because she believes the margins are high enough, or even too high. This “sense of fairness” approach never recognizes the value that the product or service brings to the prospect. If simply reducing the price were the answer, selling would be easy—and probably wouldn’t require your skills and intuition.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p04">The truth is that price is not the driving factor in most purchasing decisions. More important, pricing shouldn’t be determined based on your product cost. To be successful, you need to understand more about the value your product or service is delivering to the customer. It’s the value that should determine the price, not product cost, or even prospect objections.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_034">Tom Reilly, “What Is a Fair Price?” Tom Reilly Training, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomreillytraining.com/CPO%20article%205.htm">http://www.tomreillytraining.com/CPO%20article%205.htm</a> (accessed November 11, 2009).</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p08">Timing is everything when it comes to objections. While a prospect may raise an objection at any time during the selling process, it’s best to keep the pricing discussion until the end of your sales presentation rather than discussing it early on.

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p09">Think about the process of buying a new car. First, you go into the showroom and talk to a salesperson, then you go for a test drive and really fall in love with the car—how it handles, the smooth ride, the sound system, the GPS system, the smell of the leather seats. While you probably looked at the sticker price before you got into the car, you don’t really start talking about price until after you determined that this car has what you want. At this point, the value has been established, which makes it easier for the salesperson to sell on value than to simply sell on price.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_035">Lance Baird, “Overcoming the Price Objection,” B2B Insights Blog, October 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.godfrey.com/blog/post/2009/10/01/276">http://www.godfrey.com/blog/post/2009/10/01/276</a> (accessed November 7, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s04_p02">Even if you do your homework before you begin the selling process, there is still a good chance that a prospect may present a money objection. In some cases, the prospect’s budget may not be large enough to accommodate the cost of your product or service. If this is true, you may determine that this is a prospect for the future when his business is large enough to afford your offering. However, it is worth probing to determine if the objection is price or budget related. Like the price objection, this objection is also related to value. When prospects can’t see the value for the price, they object by saying either the price is too high or they can’t afford it. The best way to handle it is to anticipate it and be prepared:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s01_s03_p01">Your response to this objection should be something like “Salary is only one part of compensation. I’m looking for the right opportunity, and I’m willing to look at other areas of the total compensation program, including benefits, advancement, exposure, and other elements of my personal and professional growth.” It’s best not to take this conversation into a salary discussion. Wait to have the salary conversation until the company has extended an offer. It’s a good idea to have a salary range in mind <em class="emphasis">before</em> you go into an interview. Do your research on Web sites such as Salary.com so that you are prepared if your interviewer asks how much you are expecting as a starting salary.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_043">Mary Moss, “Tips for Overcoming Objections during a Job Interview,” Associated Content, August 13, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/337859/tips_for_overcoming_objections_during.html?singlepage=true&amp;cat=31">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/337859/tips_for_overcoming_objections_during.html?singlepage=true&amp;cat=31</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s01_s04_p01">When you are starting out, it will be rare to hear that you have too much experience for a particular position. However, if you do hear it, be ready with the right answer. It’s always best to seek a job you really want. But starting at a level that might be below your expectations is a good strategy, especially in this economy.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s01_s04_p02">When interviewers say this, they are worried that when the job you want comes along, you will leave. Answer this objection by pointing out that you are willing and excited about learning about the business from the ground up. Based on your research of the company, give your interviewer a specific reason about why you want to work for that particular company. People are more willing to give you a chance if you are really interested in working for the company.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s02_p01">Although there are some common objections you may hear in a job interview, chances are you will rarely hear an objection on a job interview. This is one major difference between a sales call and an interview. Most managers and recruiters respond during an interview in a more neutral way so as not to imply that the job is going to one candidate over another.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_044">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 188.</span> Prospective employers prefer to interview all the candidates and then make their hiring decision. Therefore, their objections are often more like hidden objections, those that are not openly stated during the interview. Unlike the sales call, it is not appropriate to keep probing to identify the objection. The best way to overcome objections, hidden or stated, is to be prepared to sell yourself in the most compelling way possible.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s02_p02">The concept of value, described earlier in this chapter, can be a successful way to overcome objections in a job interview whether the objections are stated or hidden. Prepare for the interview, understand the company’s needs, and demonstrate how you can meet the needs. Simple. Effective. Powerful.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_p01">After you’ve shaken hands and finished your interview, keep in mind that your ability to stand out is not over. Follow-up is the currency of sales; those who follow up significantly increase their chances of getting the sale (or getting the job). Here are some ways to follow up and make yourself memorable.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Thank-You E-mail after a Job Interview</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_s01_p01">Prospective employers want people who want to work for the company. A thank-you note can set you apart from other candidates and show your interviewer that you really want the job (it’s easy for every candidate to <em class="emphasis">say</em> she wants the job, but not every candidate writes a thank-you note).</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_s01_p02">You have the opportunity to say thank you more than once. It’s also a good idea to take advantage of every opportunity to demonstrate your interest and enthusiasm for the company. Start with a thank-you e-mail that you send the day of the interview. It’s important to use e-mail to thank your interviewer for his time, and it is also is the perfect way to deliver value. Take a minute and recap some of the topics you discussed with each interviewer (if there was more than one). Jot down a list and go online and look for an article, video, or interesting blog that would be worth sharing. Send a personal thank-you e-mail to everyone with whom you interviewed (no group e-mails here). Also, be sure to send a thank-you e-mail to the recruiter, if you worked with one to get the interview. It’s important to remember that a thank-you e-mail should be as formal and professional as a handwritten thank-you note.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_s01_p03">Now, it’s time to write your thank-you e-mail. There are three major parts to a thank-you e-mail. It can be short, but effective.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_s02_p01">Sending a thank-you e-mail is good etiquette, and it reminds your interviewer that you can deliver value to the organization. But don’t stop there. As soon as you send your thank-you e-mail, write a handwritten thank-you note to each person with whom you interviewed. You might think that it is unusual to send two thank-you notes, but it is the perfect way to communicate your interest and value to your interviewer in two ways: the thank-you e-mail demonstrates immediacy and helps you deliver value with a link to a relevant article, video, or blog, and the handwritten thank-you note provides a personal touch that few candidates take the time to do. As with the thank-you e-mail, timing is important for the handwritten note. It’s best to write and mail it the same day so your interviewer receives it within a day or two of the interview. It’s the perfect way to reinforce the fact that you go the extra mile to make an impression and build a relationship.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_s03_p01">At the end of a job interview, it’s a good idea to ask about next steps. Usually interviewers or recruiters will tell you the expected time frame in which they will make a decision. This is valuable information because it will help you determine how and when you should follow up.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s03_s03_s03_p02">If you don’t hear back from the employer or recruiter within the specified time frame, it’s recommended that you call and follow up. Companies frequently have good intentions of making a decision quickly, but other business issues take priority. Following up with a phone call helps remind your prospective employer that you are interested in the position. While it is appropriate to follow up by e-mail, it is more effective to follow up by phone. It’s easier to have a conversation with the interviewer or recruiter and get some insight about the timing as well as reinforcing why you are a good choice for the position. Continue to do research on the company so that when you follow up, you can discuss company news. For example, you might say something like “I noticed that you were recently awarded the ACON business. It sounds like this is an exciting time at the agency and one that will need some motivated salespeople. I wanted to follow up on our conversation last week to see where you stand with filling the position.”</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s04_p02">Now it’s time to put what you’ve learned into practice. Following are two roles that are involved in the same selling situation—one role is the customer, and the other is the salesperson. This will give you the opportunity to think about this selling situation from the point of view of both the customer and the salesperson.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s04_p03">Read each role carefully along with the discussion questions. Then, be prepared to play either of the roles in class using the concepts covered in this chapter. You may be asked to discuss the roles and do a role-play in groups or individually.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s04_p05">You are responsible for planning the annual meeting for the company. It is the only time that all five hundred employees are in one place. The three-day conference is usually quite a lavish affair; however, this year the budget is much smaller. Your objective is to book a five-star venue despite the budget reduction. You have just taken a tour of the lavish Premier Hotel, and you are impressed. However, the price you received in the proposal is still too high considering the fact that you would be booking five hundred rooms for three nights and three meals per day plus snacks, not to mention the additional business the lounge will realize from your attendees.</p>

The convention facilities are state-of-the-art and ideal for large corporate meetings. The accommodations are suites, not rooms, so two people can stay comfortably in each one, which helps reduce the overall cost of rooms. The service is impeccable and has ratings above the Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons. In fact, Premier Hotel has received the J. D. Power and Associates Award for the best service in the hospitality industry.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s04_p08">You have done your presentation along with a pricing proposal and presented it to the prospect. This is an important meeting for the hotel, and it’s important that you close the sale. However, first you will need to handle some objections.</p>
