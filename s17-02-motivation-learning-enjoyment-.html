        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p01">It was Super Bowl Sunday in 2005, and the New England Patriots were playing the Philadelphia Eagles. Everything was perfect for New England Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi as he waited with excited anticipation before the game, visualizing its outcome. Talk about pressure—the Patriots had a chance to win their third Super Bowl. He played with his young sons, both under the age of five at the time, on the field hours before game time; it was great that his wife Heidi came to the Alltel Stadium with the boys early so that he had some time with them before the game. He was motivated by more than simply winning this historic game; he wanted to show his sons that you can do anything you set out to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p02">The game, like the day, could not have been more perfect for Bruschi. He had a sack, seven tackles, and an interception. He was only one story in a team filled with winners. The final score was 24–21, Patriots. They had done it!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p03">It was almost impossible to go to sleep that night. In fact, Bruschi didn’t get to bed until 4:00 a.m. and then was up at the crack of dawn (literally) to appear on <em class="emphasis">Good Morning America</em>. The next few days were nonstop celebrations, interviews, and photographs. Life was indescribably good.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p04">On February 16, 2005, just ten days later, Bruschi awoke at 4:00 a.m. with a headache and numbness in his body that was so severe that he had to crawl to the bathroom. Seven hours later things went from bad to worse when his vision blurred and he could no longer move his arm or leg. At the hospital he learned that he had had a stroke.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_046">Tedy Bruschi with Michael Holley, <em class="emphasis">Never Give Up: My Stroke, My Recovery &amp; My Return to the NFL</em> (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2007).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p05">After an agonizing recovery, eight months later Bruschi returned to the game he loved. He battled back to the field and played for four more seasons before retiring in August 2009. His teammate Larry Izzo said of Bruschi, “To come back from his stroke in ’05 and play four more seasons at such a high level, was nothing less than amazing. When I think of Tedy Bruschi, I think of his toughness, his courage, the passion and desire he played with, and his production. He made plays. He was a true warrior. The heart and soul of our team.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_047">Karen Guregian, “Tedy Bruschi a Role Model to Pats, Fans,” <em class="emphasis">Boston Herald</em>, September 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view/20090901tedy_bruschi_a_role_model_to_pats_fans">http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view/20090901tedy_bruschi_a_role_model_to_pats_fans</a> (accessed September 7, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p06">What motivated Bruschi? It would have been enough just to survive a stroke, but to come back and play football at a professional level is almost unthinkable. Most players don’t ever make the cut to play in the NFL, but Bruschi survived a life-threatening stroke and came back to play at the top of his game. His passion, drive, and will to survive and win outpaced even his physical challenges.</p>

No one really believed they could do it. But even when others might not see your vision, you have to believe in yourself even when things don’t go your way. Successful sales professionals will tell you that’s what it takes to make it in sales: an unwavering belief in yourself that you can achieve the goals you set. Hard work? Absolutely. Setbacks? Just about every day. Believing in yourself?

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s03_p01">It may seem counterintuitive, but the best way to succeed is to fail. The fact is, failures can be a positive experience because they can help you avoid repeating mistakes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651545">Stacy Blackman, “Want to Succeed? Learn How to Fail,” BNET, July 21, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/mba/?p=962">http://blogs.bnet.com/mba/?p=962</a> (accessed September 7, 2009).</span> Since failures are much more painful than the sweet taste of success, we tend to remember our failures more vividly.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651560">Dave Kahle, “Learning from Failure,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em>, February 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.davekahle.com/article/learningfromfailure.html">http://www.davekahle.com/article/learningfromfailure.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> But as important as the actual failure is what you do as a result of the experience. “You don’t have control over what happens to you in life,” says Lisa Peskin, sales trainer at Business Development University, “but you absolutely have control over how you choose to handle it.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651575">Lisa Peskin, “Top 10 Secrets of Selling in a Recession” <em class="emphasis">Philadelphia Business Journal</em> Workshop, Philadelphia, PA, July 29, 2009.</span> Peskin has over twenty years of experience in business-to-business (B2B) selling. To overcome the feeling of failure especially on daily sales calls, she suggests the “rocking chair test”: will you remember that someone said no to you today when you are sitting in a rocking chair fifty years from now? “Don’t get upset over the small stuff” is her advice to salespeople. “If you want something you never had, you must do something you’ve never done, and that may result in some failures, but a lot of successes.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651591">Lisa Peskin, “Top 10 Secrets of Selling in a Recession,” <em class="emphasis">Philadelphia Business Journal</em> Workshop, Philadelphia, PA, July 29, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s03_p02">It might be hard to imagine that successful people ever had failures. But Shantanu Narayen, CEO of software maker Adobe Systems, says, “You know, there is no such thing as failure. You’re always learning.” He goes on to share his personal experiences: “I have looked back at aspects of my career where somebody might look at it and say, you know, that start-up was not successful, and I look at it and I say, ‘I learned how to build a team, how to raise money, how to sell a vision, how to create a product.’ It was a great steppingstone for me.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_057">Adam Bryant, “Connecting the Dots Isn’t Enough,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 19, 2009, business, 2.</span></p>

Although the White Sox were eventually named World Champions again in 2005, each member of the team missed more balls than they hit. In baseball, a 0.333 batting average is considered outstanding (Ty Cobb’s average, the highest in baseball is 0.366), which means that the batter misses almost seven times out of every ten at bats. Similarly, an average of 70 percent of people who walk into a retail store don’t buy anything, and 99 percent of people who visit a company’s Web site don’t make a purchase.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_058">Baseball Almanac, “Career Leaders for Batting Average,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hibavg1.shtml">http://www.baseball-almanac.com/hitting/hibavg1.shtml</a> (accessed September 7, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_059">Amanda Ferrante, “Retailers Counting on Conversion to Drive Store Metrics,” Retail Store Ops Blog, March 17, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://retailstoreops.blogspot.com/2008/03/retailers-counting-on-conversion.html">http://retailstoreops.blogspot.com/2008/03/retailers-counting-on-conversion.html</a> (accessed September 7, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_060">The Conversion Chronicles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.conversionchronicles.com/">http://www.conversionchronicles.com/</a>, September 7, 2009 (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> So, it is inevitable that you will have to fail in order to succeed.

Conflicting priorities; lack of time; demands of work, family, and friends; the negativity of some people; and even the state of the economy can take a toll on you. Stress is a real part of everyday life; unfortunately there is no magic formula to avoid it. But you can learn to balance work and your personal life for a better balance and potentially less stress.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s04_s01_p01">Have you ever been on an airplane and listened to the directions from the flight attendant about safety? She says that in case of an emergency, put on your oxygen mask first and then help those around you to put theirs on. The theory is that you can’t really help anyone else until you are taken care of. That same theory applies to mental, emotional, and physical health. You won’t be able to provide support and ideas to your customers unless you are healthy in mind and body. To start off every day with the energy and enthusiasm to conquer the world, take the time to take care of yourself with the following tips:</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Get a good night’s sleep</strong>. Avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, and go to sleep early. It’s best not to assume that your current sleep time is enough; experiment with what is your optimum night’s sleep.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_067">Donald Latumahina, “How to Get Your Morning Off to a Great Start,” Life Optimizer Blog, July 28, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2009/07/28/how-to-get-your-morning-off-to-a-great-start">http://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2009/07/28/how-to-get-your-morning-off-to-a-great-start</a> (accessed August 19, 2009).</span>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Eat a healthy breakfast</strong>. You might think you don’t have time, but it’s best to make time to eat breakfast. It provides fuel to start your day. A healthy breakfast can be fast and easy, especially if you plan it the night before. Oatmeal with almonds, cold cereal with fruit, a smoothie with fruit, low-fat yogurt and wheat germ, and even cold veggie pizza can be a healthy breakfast. You owe it to yourself to start right. Use some tips from this article from the Mayo Clinic for some healthy options: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/NU00197">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/NU00197</a>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_068">Mayo Clinic Staff, “Healthy Breakfast: Quick, Flexible Options to Grab at Home,” MayoClinic.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/NU00197">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/food-and-nutrition/NU00197</a> (accessed September 8, 2009).</span>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exercise</strong>. It’s a good idea to do some kind of regular physical exercise such as working out or walking. This helps reduce stress and helps you manage weight.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t procrastinate; get right into your day</strong>. Jump in with both feet and start your day off right.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Start your day with the most important task</strong>. Use your prioritized to-do list and conquer the most important item first; leave everything else for later. You might be tempted to do the small things first so you can scratch them off you list. But when you take on the more important and biggest challenge first, you have the most amount of energy and drive. And you will have a huge sense of accomplishment with time to spare for your smaller to-dos.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_070">Jonathan Figaro, “A Simple Tip to Be More Productive,” Life Optimizer Blog, July 25, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2009/07/18/be-more-productive">http://www.lifeoptimizer.org/2009/07/18/be-more-productive</a> (accessed August 19, 2009).</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Smile and enjoy your day</strong>. Your attitude sets the tone for your customers. Always wear a warm, genuine smile; people like to do business with people who enjoy what they do. A smile can break tension in a meeting and put everyone at ease.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_071">Diane Gray, “Some Sales Tips from the Best Salespersons,” Associated Content, March 14, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/166636/some_sales_tips_from_the_best_salespersons.html?cat=35">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/166636/some_sales_tips_from_the_best_salespersons.html?cat=35</a> (accessed August 19, 2009).</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Don’t worry about what you can’t control</strong>. Worry causes stress, and stress breeds doubt. It’s a good idea to make a list of all the things that are causing stress in your life. Review them and identify which ones you have control over and develop an action plan to take control over that element. For those over which you don’t have control, don’t stress. It’s simply a waste of time to worry about things you can’t control.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_072">Tim W.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Take time for yourself</strong>. Chances are you have multiple responsibilities and demands including work, family, school, community, and others. Even though you want to do it all, it’s a good idea to schedule some time for yourself regularly. Do something that you enjoy whether it is reading a book, going to the mall, or taking a bike ride. This “me time” can go a long way to rejuvenate yourself and refresh you to take on the next big challenge.</li>
