    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_p01">It was 4:00 p.m. on Christmas Eve and Ray Rizzo’s father, in town for the annual family get-together, had forgotten to bring his suit. What made the situation even more challenging was that Ray’s father is rather portly with a forty-eight-inch waist and even broader shoulders, a build that requires a fifty-three-short jacket. Ray and his father rushed to Mitchells, a local clothing store in Connecticut, and asked Jack Mitchell, the owner, for his help. It was hard to imagine that Ray’s father would possibly be able to get a suit or even a sport jacket tailored to fit in time for the family gathering. After all, it was Christmas Eve, and the store would be closing in an hour. Jack didn’t hesitate and immediately enlisted Domenic, the head tailor, and before 6 o’clock that evening, the largest pair of pants and jacket in the store were tailored to fit Ray’s father perfectly. Needless to say, Ray is a customer for life.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_001">Jack Mitchell, <em class="emphasis">Hug Your Customers: The Proven Way to Personalize Sales and Achieve Astounding Results</em> (New York: Hyperion, 2003), 22.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_p02">This situation is what Jack Mitchell calls a hug. If you go shopping for clothes at Mitchells or Richards in Connecticut, you will get hugged. Maybe not literally, but you will most definitely get “hugged” figuratively. Jack Mitchell, the CEO of Mitchells/Richards and author of <em class="emphasis">Hug Your Customers: The Proven Way to Personalize Sales and Achieve Astounding Results</em>, says, “Hugging is a way of thinking about customers. To us, hugging is a softer word for passion and relationships. It’s a way of getting close to your customers and truly understanding them.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_002">Jack Mitchell, <em class="emphasis">Hug Your Customers: The Proven Way to Personalize Sales and Achieve Astounding Results</em> (New York: Hyperion, 2003), 28.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">From Personal to Problem Solving</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_p01">Think about your best friend. You know her so well that you can just about finish each other’s sentences. You know her favorite flavor and brand of ice cream, and you can sense when she is having a bad day. You text and talk to her all the time; you even go out of your way to surprise her sometimes with a gift that you know she will like. You have a great relationship with her.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_p02">Now think about the last time you went into your favorite restaurant. Was it the same kind of experience? Did the host greet you by name and seat you at your favorite table? Did the waitperson remember that you like to drink raspberry-flavored iced tea? Was your fish served with the sauce on the side, just the way you like it? Were you delighted with a new flavor of cappuccino after dinner? When these things happen, the people at the restaurant make you feel special; after all, you are the reason they are there. When you have a relationship like this with the people at the restaurant, you are more inclined to return to the restaurant again and again. If these things don’t happen, it is easier for you to choose a different restaurant the next time you go out.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_p03">The bottom line is that to be successful in selling, any kind of selling, you have to make selling personal. People do business with people, not with companies. Even in the business-to-business (B2B) selling channel, it is people who are making decisions on behalf of the company for which they work. Every sale starts with a relationship. If your relationship is strong, there is a higher likelihood of a sale and a loyal repeat customer. That means you have to get to know your customer on a one-to-one basis to understand what he wants, what he needs, and what resources he has. This concept is called relationship selling (or consultative selling).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_003">Claire Sykes, “Relationship Selling,” <em class="emphasis">Surface Fabrication</em> 12, no. 1 (January–February 2006): 58.</span> It is defined by working personally with your customer to understand his needs, put his needs first, and provide consultation to help him make the best decision for himself or his business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_p07">You might be thinking that selling is about the product or service, not about relationships. But that’s not true. You may have heard someone say, “He’s just a pushy salesman,” or you may have experienced someone trying to give you the “hard sell.” The fact is that selling has evolved dramatically over the past thirty years. Business is more competitive. The use of technology and the expanded number of product and service offerings have developed a need for consultative selling in more industries than ever before. It used to be that salespeople wanted to simply make a sale, which meant that the sale began and ended with the transaction. But now, it’s not enough to just make the sale. In today’s competitive world, it’s how you think about the customer that matters.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_004">Jack Mitchell, <em class="emphasis">Hug Your Customers: The Proven Way to Personalize Sales and Achieve Astounding Results</em> (New York: Hyperion, 2003), 16.</span> It’s the difference between giving the customer what she needs rather than what you want to sell her.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_005">Jack Mitchell, <em class="emphasis">Hug Your Customers: The Proven Way to Personalize Sales and Achieve Astounding Results</em> (New York: Hyperion, 2003), 20.</span> The fact is that the sale is just one small part of the relationship. The real essence of selling is in the relationship.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_006">Jeffrey Gitomer, “The Difference between an Account and a Relationship,” <em class="emphasis">Long Island Business News</em>, August 3, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://libn.com/blog/2007/08/03/the-difference-between-an-account-and-a-relationship/">http://libn.com/blog/2007/08/03/the-difference-between-an-account-and-a-relationship/</a> (accessed June 29, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_p04">The salesperson has a new role in most companies. The days of the salesperson as “product pusher” are just about gone. Customers in B2B and business-to-consumer (B2C) environments want and demand more. Consider the evolution of some major industries. Many of the leading hotel chains keep your preferences in a database so that their front desk sales team can recognize you personally at check-in and provide the queen-sized bed in a nonsmoking room on the quiet side of the property that you prefer. Restaurants work hard to learn, remember, and greet you by your name, maintain your favorite table, wine, and entrée, and prepare to anticipate your every need. Airlines have tools to recognize you and the fact that you like an aisle seat as far forward as possible in the plane.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_007">Jim Sullivan and Phil Roberts, <em class="emphasis">Service That Sells! The Art of Profitable Hospitality</em> (Denver: Pencom Press, 1991), 151.</span> All these tactics are steeped in the theory that customers make choices on the relationship they have with brands. In each one of these situations, the salesperson is the difference that sets a brand apart at the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">moment of truth</a><span class="glossdef">Any time the customer comes in contact with a brand.</span></span>, the moment the customer comes in contact with the brand.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_008">Howard Lax, “Fun, Fun, Fun in a Customer Experience Way,” <em class="emphasis">Banking Strategies</em> 84, no. 6 (November–December 2008): 64.</span> Some brands understand how important each moment of truth is when creating relationships with customers. For example, Southwest Airlines makes their Web site easy to use, has humans answer the phone, and has flight and ground attendants that make it a pleasure to travel with them.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_p05">Johnson Controls, manufacturer of heating and air conditioning systems, thinks that consultative selling is so important that it holds a Basic Boot Camp for the company’s territory managers at its headquarters in Norman, Oklahoma, that focuses on leveraging relationships in selling. The classroom-style “boot camp” includes interactive exercises, product training, and business support training. The company’s commitment to consultative selling doesn’t end there. Participants who score at least an 85 percent on their final grade for the Basic Boot Camp and spend six months out in the field can qualify to attend the elite Special Operations Training, which is by invitation only.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_009">“Johnson Controls Runs Boot Camp,” <em class="emphasis">Heating &amp; Refrigeration News</em> 233, no. 6 (April 14, 2008).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p01">Selling relationships start as personal relationships. Making a personal connection is vital in the two to ten minutes of a customer encounter or meeting.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_012">Cathy Berch, “Consultative Selling: Ask, Don’t Tell,” <em class="emphasis">Community Banker</em> 18, no. 4 (April 2009): 261.</span> Think about the last time you bought a new cell phone. Chances are, if the person didn’t establish rapport with you from the start, you probably walked away and bought the phone from a different salesperson, maybe even at a different store. The relationship includes a sincere bond that goes beyond business and includes common interests and goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_013">Tom Reilly, “Relationship Selling at Its Best,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Distribution</em> 25, no. 9 (September 2006): 29.</span> If you are selling medical imaging equipment to hospitals, you want to build relationships with the administrators, doctors, and nurses who will be using your equipment in each hospital. When you build a relationship starting with what’s important to each person individually, it’s easier to expand that relationship to sharing information and problem solving from a business perspective. As Bob Fitta, a manufacturer’s rep for several tool companies said about Paul Robichaud, owner of Robi Tools, “I got to know him as a business person and a real person, and that relationship has endured.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_014">Brad Perriello, “Relationship—Selling at its Best,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Distribution</em> 97, no. 9 (September 2008): 34.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p02">But consultative selling is more than simply building rapport. In fact, consultative selling goes beyond the product or service you are selling; it even goes beyond the selling process. It is the “X factor,” the intangible element that makes a customer choose your product or service even when the competition is priced lower. Consultative selling is about <em class="emphasis">your</em> personal involvement and sincere focus on problem solving that goes beyond selling to true partnership with the customer.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p03">Consultative selling doesn’t start and stop at specific times during the relationship. In fact, it defines the relationship before the sale, during the sale, and after the sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_015">Cathy Berch, “Don’t Wing It,” <em class="emphasis">Community Banker</em> 18, no. 2 (February 2009): 18.</span> You will learn about the seven steps of the selling process in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch07#fwk-125752-ch07">Chapter 7 "Prospecting and Qualifying: The Power to Identify Your Customers"</a> through <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch13#fwk-125752-ch13">Chapter 13 "Follow-Up: The Power of Providing Service That Sells"</a> and how building long-term relationships and consultative selling are the basis of each step. The concept of building professional relationships is apparent in this example: If you are selling insurance, consider the fact that your customer may eventually buy a home, have a family, or purchase a second property. So the relationship you develop when you sell him car insurance as a young single man could and should be nurtured and developed over time to provide solutions that answer his needs as his lifestyle changes. Having this long-term view of customer relationships is called focusing on <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">lifetime value</a><span class="glossdef">The worth of the transactions that are done with a customer over the life of a relationship with a company.</span></span>. It means that you consider not just one transaction with a customer, but also the help and insight you can provide throughout the entire time frame during which you do business with him. So, although you may only provide him with basic car insurance now, over the course of more than twenty-five years that you do business with him, you may ultimately sell him thousands of dollars of insurance and investment products that meet his changing needs. But that won’t happen if you don’t continue your relationship and keep in touch, focusing on topics and events that are important to him. If you focus only on the immediate sale, you will miss a lot of business, not to mention future referrals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p04">There are several elements that can be included in the calculation of the lifetime value of a customer. However, a simple formula is</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">dollar value of purchase × gross profit percent × number of purchases.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p05">For example, if a customer shopped at a retailer and spent $75 on one purchase that had a gross profit of 30 percent, the lifetime value of that customer would be $22.50, calculated as</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$75 × 30% × 1 = $22.50.</span></span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s01_p06">If the customer made five purchases for $75 each over the course of the time she shopped with the retailer (let’s say five years), at a gross profit of 30 percent, the lifetime value of the customer would be $112.50, calculated as</p>
            <span class="informalequation block"><span class="mathphrase">$75 × 30% × 5 = $112.50.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_016">Michael Gray, “How Do You Determine Customer Lifetime Value?” Profit Advisors, May 20, 1999, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.profitadvisors.com/busfaq/lifetime.shtml">http://www.profitadvisors.com/busfaq/lifetime.shtml</a> (accessed November 30, 2009).</span></span></span>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p01">With so many demands on your time as a salesperson, sometimes it’s easy to lose track of some customers and not follow up, which means that you may only be developing short-term relationships. Or you might unintentionally let your relationship with a customer “lapse into laziness,” which means that you let the relationship run on autopilot, relying on your established relationship to keep the business going. In this case, there’s usually no pressing reason to change; you might think that as long as the customer is happy, everything is OK. But it’s best to avoid complacency because the world is constantly changing. While you are enjoying a comfortable, easy relationship, there are probably new business challenges that you should be learning about from your customer. Or worse, you may open the door to a competitor because you weren’t bringing new and relevant ideas to your customer and he began to think of you more as a nice guy than a resource for advice and new ideas.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_017">Claire Sykes, “Relationship Selling,” <em class="emphasis">Surface Fabrication</em> 12, no. 1 (January–February 2006): 58.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p02">Many companies use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer relationship management (CRM)</a><span class="glossdef">The process a company uses to organize and track their current and potential customer information.</span></span> tools, which are technology solutions that organize all of a customer’s interactions with a company in one place. In other words, CRM is a customer database that holds all the information regarding a transaction (e.g., date; products purchased; salesperson who sold the products; and name, address, and contact information of the customer). In addition, it captures all communication the customer has had with the company, including calls made to the company call center, posts and reviews made to the company Web site, and the details of each sales call made by a salesperson. Some CRM tools are extremely sophisticated and help the salesperson and the company to manage relationships with prospects and customers. Other CRM tools are simpler and are focused on helping the salesperson manage her relationship with prospects and customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_018">SearchCRM.com, “CRM (Customer Relationship Management),” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/CRM">http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/CRM</a> (accessed November 30, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p03">A CRM tool works in a variety of ways. Here are a few examples. A construction contractor calls a toll-free number for a plumbing supply company after seeing an ad in a trade journal. The prospect inquiry is sent via e-mail to the appropriate salesperson. The salesperson reviews the CRM system to see if there have been any previous contacts with the customer and if there is any information about the customer and his business. Then he returns the prospect’s phone call and sets up a date to meet him to learn more about his business needs. The salesperson makes a note in the CRM system about the phone call and the date of the meeting and sets a follow-up reminder for himself for the meeting and for three days after the meeting. When the salesperson meets with the prospect, he learns that the prospect has five developments that he manages. The salesperson makes a note in the CRM system so everyone from the company who comes in contact with the prospect, such as other salespeople or customer service, know this information about the prospect.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s02_p04">CRM tools can be extremely helpful in managing customer relationships, especially where there are multiple people in the company who come in contact with prospects and customers. CRM tools also make it easier to understand the lifetime value of a customer since all purchases, inquiries, and other contacts are included in the system. It is the information that is gathered in a CRM system that helps a salesperson better understand customer behavior, communication patterns, and short- as well as long-term needs. For example, many companies offer loyalty programs as a tactic to increase sales but also to gather information about customer preferences to offer more relevant messages and offers. CRM tools are used to manage loyalty programs, such as Best Buy Rewards Zone, Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards, and the Safeway card for their different local grocery chains. This information is then used for marketing and selling purposes. Best Buy can identify all the recent purchasers of Hewlett-Packard (HP) printers and send them an e-mail for HP ink cartridges. CRM tools are used to manage customer relationships in other ways. For example, Starbucks uses Salesforce.com, a widely used CRM tool, to power their MyStarbucksIdea Web site. The Web site is a collaboration and feedback tool that engages customers in providing ideas to the company. To manage the relationships with customers online, Starbucks uses a CRM tool. This allows Starbucks to provide personal feedback to each customer on all the ideas they submit. Visit MyStarbucksIdea.com to see this interactive suggestion box.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s01_s03_p02">In this world of high-tech instant communication, some relationships can easily become “low-touch,” or missing the human element. Meeting with and entertaining customers is an important part of the selling process. It helps you get to know customers in an environment outside the office, in a casual or social place such as a restaurant, sporting event, or concert. These can be excellent opportunities for you and your customer to “let your hair down,” relax, and enjoy each other’s company. Many sales positions include an entertainment budget for this reason. Taking someone out to eat is not the only part of a selling relationship, but it’s an important part of building and developing a connection. One sales manager said that he can tell when one of his salespeople is struggling simply by reviewing his expense reports. He looks for activities that take place outside business hours because those are the activities that build relationships. In fact, according to one study, 71 percent of top-achieving salespeople use entertainment as a way to get closer to their customers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_020">Tom Reilly, “Relationship Selling at Its Best,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Distribution</em> 25, no. 9 (September 2006): 29.</span></p>

Sending a thank-you note after a meeting, forwarding an article or video on a topic you discussed, remembering the names of your customer’s children, even providing a personal suggestion for a vacation spot are all examples of little things that can set you apart from every other salesperson. You might think that these “little things” aren’t important when you get into the big world of business.

When people make promises that they don’t keep, you lose trust in them. It’s unlikely that you will trust a person who doesn’t deliver on what he or she says.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s02_p02">Trust is a critical element in every relationship. Think again about your best friend. Is she someone you can trust? If you tell her something in confidence, does she keep it to herself? If you need her for any reason, will she be there for you? Chances are, you answered “yes,” which is why she is your best friend. You believe that she will do what she says she will do, and probably more.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s02_p03">You can see why trust is so important in selling. If your customer doesn’t believe that you will actually do what you say you are going to do, you do not have a future in selling. Trust is built on open and honest communication. Trust is about building partnerships. Salespeople build trust by following up on their promises. They are accessible (many times 24/7), and they work to help their customers succeed. Customers trust you when they believe you have <em class="emphasis">their</em> best interest at heart, not your personal motivation. According to Tom Reilly, author of the book <em class="emphasis">Value Added Selling</em>, “Consultative selling is less about technique and more about trust.” Trust is what gives a relationship value. It is the cornerstone of selling. Trust creates value. In fact, one B2B customer described his salesperson by saying he was like an employee of the company. Another described her salesperson in terms of problem ownership by saying, “When we have a problem, he has a problem.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_024">Tom Reilly, “Relationship Selling at Its Best,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Distribution</em> 25, no. 9 (September 2006): 29.</span> Trust is equally important in B2C selling. For example, at Zen Lifestyle, a salon in Edinburgh, United Kingdom, the approach to customers is described as soft sell with a focus on educating customers and providing information. Customers are encouraged to try products in the smallest size to determine whether they like the product. It is only after they have liked it that larger and more economical sizes are suggested. “This helps develop a relationship between customers and therapist built on trust, which in turn will generate future sales from recommendations,” according to salon owner Fiona Macarthur.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_025">Annette Hanford, “Best Sellers Tell All,” <em class="emphasis">Health &amp; Beauty Salon</em> 25, no. 12 (December 2003): 50.</span> In every business, these are all powerful testaments to great salespeople.</p>

That’s what Susan Marcus Beohm, a sales manager for a handheld dental instrument manufacturer suggests. “I don’t go in as a salesperson—I go in looking to see how I can help them. Not bringing my goods and wares with me says, ‘I’m here to find out what you need,’ and it makes an impact.” When salespeople are too eager to start talking about features and benefits before they listen to the customer, they make it more difficult to establish trust.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_026">“A Foundation Built on Trust,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, August 8, 2001, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=146">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=146</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Underpromise and Overdeliver</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s02_s01_p01">One of the tenets of selling is establishing trust and setting expectations. The best salespeople underpromise and overdeliver. In other words, they say they will do something by a certain day, and then not only do they do it, but they deliver it one day early. Here’s a way to think about the power of this approach: if you order a new pair of jeans online and the estimated date of delivery is Tuesday, but you receive them on Monday, you are delighted. You are pleased that they came early. However, if the jeans were promised for Tuesday delivery, but they arrived on Wednesday, you would be disappointed and probably would not trust that Web site for timely delivery in the future. You can imagine how this strategy builds trust with customers—not only can you rely on the salesperson to do what she said, but she never lets you down and even delivers earlier than promised sometimes. That’s how trust is built between salesperson and customer, and the relationship goes to the next level: partnership.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p01">No one likes to deliver bad news. But it’s not always good news that you will have to tell a customer. The best antidote for bad news is a good relationship. If you have nurtured your relationship with the customer and built trust, it is much easier to deliver bad news. When it’s time to deliver bad news, like a delayed delivery, a cost increase, or a discontinued product line, don’t put it off. Use the same practices that you use to build your relationships: open, honest, and timely communication.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s02_s02_p02">As soon as you learn about information that may be bad news for your customer, contact her by phone to discuss the situation: “I realize we set Thursday as the installation date for phase one, but there have been some delays in development. Can we reschedule it for next Tuesday? I’m confident that everything will be complete by then. I apologize for any inconvenience. Let’s talk about any challenges this may cause on your end. I have some ideas about how we might work around them.” The sincerity in your voice and the dialogue you have with the customer can help avoid turning bad news into a serious problem. Because you have always made a point of underpromising and overdelivering, there is a high likelihood that your customer will respond positively to your ownership of the problem and solution-based conversation. It’s always best to include a realistic solution to the problem and, if you don’t have a solution, let the customer know exactly when you will get back to her with an update.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s03_p01">If you do volunteer work for an organization such as Autism Speaks, you get involved because you believe in raising awareness of autism to increase funds for research for the cure. Those who have autism and their families benefit from your involvement. This is win #1. You also benefit because you gain the satisfaction of helping people. This is win #2. You help build the strength of the organization, in this case, Autism Speaks. The more people that are involved, the more people they can reach with their message, and the more money they can raise to reach their goal of curing autism. This is win #3.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s03_p02">The above example is an illustration of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">win-win-win</a><span class="glossdef">All parties in a relationship win—your customer, you, and your company or organization.</span></span> concept in relationships. In other words, in the ultimate relationship, all parties have something to give and something to gain. This same win-win-win occurs in successful selling relationships. Your customer wins because he gets your advice and expertise to help him find a product or service that meets his needs. You win because you have enhanced your relationship and made a sale; and your company wins because the relationship, the sale, and the repeat sales help it achieve its goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s03_p03">Although the win-win-win may sound like a simple concept, it is a critical one to keep in mind in any business position, especially in selling. This art of collaboration actually results in more business with your existing customers because you have become a partner in solving their problems, and it brings you new business in the form of referrals. The win-win-win also plays a significant role in the negotiating process (covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch12#fwk-125752-ch12">Chapter 12 "Closing the Sale: The Power of Negotiating to Win"</a>).

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s03_s01_p02">The seat at the table is given to those salespeople who deliver value, not sell products or services. They develop the relationship to assist customers in implementing their business strategies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_030">J. D. Williams, Robert Everett, and Elizabeth Rogol, “Will the Human Factors of Relationship Selling Survive in the Twenty-First Century?” <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Commerce &amp; Management</em> 19, no. 2 (2009): 158.</span> Customers want value in the form of strategic thinking around issues that are important to them and their company goals. As a result, your goal as a salesperson should be to help your customers create demand, secure a competitive advantage, and identify a new niche. When you deliver this kind of value, your customers will no longer see you as a salesperson; they will see you as a “business person who sells.” It’s this kind of thinking and value creation that earn you a seat at the table. The seat at the table also helps you expand your business because you will be integrated into your customer’s business. That allows you to deliver your core products or services and be a part of developing the new opportunities. It helps cement the relationship and establishes a partnership that delivers value for all involved.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_031">Marc Miller, “A Seat at the Table,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em> 54, no. 5 (May 2009): 9.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s03_s01_p01">Every salesperson wants “a seat at the table”; she wants to be a part of the decision-making process. That is the epitome of consultative selling: you are included in the process from the beginning. You want to be included as a valued partner with your business-to-business customers to discuss their company’s strategic questions like “How will we grow our business in the next three years while technology is driving down the average selling price of our product?” “How can we extend our relationship with our customers beyond our contract period?” or “How can we expand to new markets and minimize our risk?” These are not traditional sales questions; they are strategic issues that companies wrestle with. When you are a true partner with your customers, you will be given a seat at the table when direction-setting issues are discussed. This allows you to participate fully as a trusted advisor and asset to the customer and to help shape the strategy of the company. It changes your relationship with the contact and the company from salesperson to partner. Although it may seem like a lofty goal, consider this: If you want to have a seat at the table, not only will you need to solve your customer’s problems and anticipate her needs, but according to Tim Conner, sales trainer and author, you will also need to be a creative problem creator. That means that you will be in constant pursuit of identifying problems that your customer didn’t even know she had. In other words, it means that you have to think <em class="emphasis">ahead</em> of your customer, not just along with her.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650526">Tim Conner, “Sales Strategies of Six-Figure Salespeople,” TimConnor.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.timconnor.com/articles_sales.html">http://www.timconnor.com/articles_sales.html</a> (accessed June 29, 2009).</span></p>

Although networking isn’t exactly quid pro quo (something for something), it does include the element of exchange: if someone is looking for something, someone else can provide the information. What makes the network function is the fact that people in the network at some point have a need and at some point may be able to help someone else with his need. Said another way, networking is based on mutual generosity.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_034">Meredith Levinson, “How to Network: 12 Tips for Shy People,” <em class="emphasis">CIO</em>, December 11, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cio.com/article/164300/How_to_Network_Tips_for_Shy_People?page=1">http://www.cio.com/article/164300/How_to_Network_Tips_for_Shy_People?page=1</a> (accessed July 3, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s04_p03">Networking is an important part of the business world and an even more vital part of sales. It’s no longer a question of “if” you should network; it’s a requirement to stay competitive because it’s virtually impossible to do your job alone. Just as in social networking, professional networking allows you to leverage the people you know to expand your relationship to people you don’t know. Building strong relationships with customers is an excellent way to build your network. Satisfied customers will refer you to other people who might become potential customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s01_s04_p04">It’s best to always be networking rather than networking only when you want something. It makes it easier to network and expand your relationships when you’re not asking for something. It also gives you the opportunity to help someone else first, which can go a long way when you need help in the future.</p>

If you come with someone, be sure to branch out to meet and mingle with other people. Set a time and a place to meet the person with whom you came so you can both maximize your networking. According to Peter Handel, the chairman and CEO of Dale Carnegie &amp; Associates, a smile can be your greatest asset when networking in person. He suggests always asking questions of the people you meet; it helps keep conversation going and gives you more insight into their background and how you might work together in the future. But the other side of asking questions is listening; that’s how you will learn. And always have your business cards handy. Give out your business card to those you talk to, and don’t forget to get their business cards, too.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_037">Meredith Levinson, “How to Network: 12 Tips for Shy People,” <em class="emphasis">CIO</em>, December 11, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cio.com/article/164300/How_to_Network_Tips_for_Shy_People?page=1">http://www.cio.com/article/164300/How_to_Network_Tips_for_Shy_People?page=1</a> (accessed July 3, 2009).</span></p>

Networking is so much more than that. Networking is about creating mutually beneficial relationships. It’s best to use one of the basic practices for building relationships when networking: keeping in touch. That means dropping an e-mail to someone with whom you have networked just to find out how their big project is going, how their twins’ birthday celebration went, or even just to say hi. Go beyond the e-mail by inviting someone to lunch. It’s the perfect way to build a relationship, share common ground, and learn more about the person.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_038">Donna Rosato, “Networking for People Who Hate to Network,” <em class="emphasis">CNNMoney.com</em>, April 3, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/02/news/economy/networking_jobs.moneymag/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/2009/04/02/news/economy/networking_jobs.moneymag/index.htm</a> (accessed July 3, 2009).</span> Many people are gung ho about networking and meeting people, but rarely keep in touch.

Perhaps it’s your father or mother or a professor. <em class="emphasis">Analyticals</em> are all about the facts. They are defined by low responsiveness and low assertiveness. In other words, they like to hear about the pros and cons and all the details before they decide. They are likely to have a financial or technical background, and they pride themselves on being an expert in their field. They want to hear about the tangible results, timelines, and details before they make a decision. In fact, they are the ones who will actually read the directions before they put together a new grill or set up a wireless home network. They are so focused on facts that they prefer to disregard personal opinions in their decision making. They like to understand all the facts before they decide so they know exactly how the product, service, or contract arrangement will work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_048">Barton A.

In other words, don’t challenge her facts and point of view. Rather, provide history, data, financial details, and other facts in an organized, structured format. She will ask many questions so that she clearly understands the product or service. Since it’s important for her to make the right decision, she will take the time to gather all the facts. Because she puts so much effort into making the right decision, she tends to be loyal to the people from whom she buys, believing she doesn’t need to reevaluate the same facts.</p>

However, drivers are different from analyticals because they make decisions quickly. On the social style matrix, they are in the low responsiveness, high assertiveness quadrant. These are the people who are “control freaks”; they are decisive and controlling. They work with people because they have to; they see other people only as a means to their end of achievement. They are smart, focused, independent, and competitive. They have little regard for the opinions of others; a driver is rarely described as a “people person.” They are high achievers who are in a hurry to meet their goals.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_051">Rick English, “Finding Your Selling Style,” San Diego State University, Marketing 377 class notes, chapter 5, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~renglish/377/notes/chapt05">http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/~renglish/377/notes/chapt05</a> (accessed July 7, 2009).</span> They don’t want facts just for the sake of having them; they want relevant information that will help them decide quickly.</p>

(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 171.</span> Networking is sometimes referred to as the “hidden job market” because many jobs are filled before they are ever posted. This is true now more than ever because of the challenging economy. Traffic at job boards like Monster.com, CareerBuilder.com, and Yahoo! HotJobs is up 37 percent over last year, which means that companies are deluged with résumés. Despite the influx in résumés, companies are using more networking—traditional and online—to fill their open jobs. In fact, about 50 percent of Facebook’s new hires come from referrals from existing employees. According to Molly Graham, manager of Facebook Human Resources and Recruitment, “One of our main philosophies is to get smart and talented people. They tend to be connected.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_p02">Zappos, a billion-dollar online retailer of shoes and apparel that was recently purchased by Amazon, has taken employee referrals to the next level and has implemented software that lets employees use their LinkedIn and Twitter contacts. The software uses an algorithm to identify people who might have a skill set and experience match for open positions and then allows employees to invite the prospective candidate to apply.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_058">Joseph De Avila, “Beyond Job Boards,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, July 2, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203872404574260032327828514.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203872404574260032327828514.html</a> (accessed July 3, 2009).</span></p>

But you might be wondering where you start and exactly how you network effectively. Like everything else in selling, you need to develop a plan.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Create a Networking Plan</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_p01">Before you start, it’s a good idea to review exactly what networking is and what it isn’t. Just as in selling, networking is about building relationships that are mutually beneficial; it is about the exchange of value between people, usually over the course of time. Someone might help you now, and you might help that same person or someone else later. It requires a relationship and ongoing commitment. Networking isn’t a quick, easy way to get a job. Although it can be instrumental in helping you get a job, it isn’t easy, and it might not be quick. You should approach networking for the long term and realize that you will help some people and some people will help you. You have the power to help other people and to ask for help; that’s how networking works. To help guide you, here are six power networking tips.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Power Networking Tip #1: Network with Confidence</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s01_p01">Don’t think of networking as begging for a job. Start building relationships with people—family, friends, professors, and executives—now. That will give you the opportunity to build relationships and potentially help someone even before you begin your job search. When you do begin networking to find a job, be yourself and get to know as many people as possible using the methods described earlier in the chapter (e.g., professional organizations, events). Keep in mind that you may have the opportunity one day to help the person with whom you are networking, so network with confidence.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_059">Meredith Levinson, “How to Network: 12 Tips for Shy People,” <em class="emphasis">CIO</em>, December 11, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cio.com/article/164300/How_to_Network_Tips_for_Shy_People?page=1">http://www.cio.com/article/164300/How_to_Network_Tips_for_Shy_People?page=1</a> (accessed July 3, 2009).</span> You will be surprised at how many people are willing to help you because you ask.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Power Networking Tip #2: Join Professional Organizations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s02_p01">There’s no better place to meet people you want to work with than to go where they go. Professional organizations such as your local chapter of Sales &amp; Marketing Executives International, American Marketing Association, Entrepreneurs Organization, Public Relations Society of America, and others provide the perfect environment to meet people in the industry in which you want to work. Start by exploring the professional organizations on campus. Many are local chapters of national organizations designed to encourage students to get involved. If you don’t know which organization is best for you, ask a professor; she will be happy to provide some insight. Or go to a meeting and check it out; most organizations allow nonmembers to attend at least one meeting or event at no charge. A good number of professional organizations offer student membership rates that are designed for student budgets. Besides providing an excellent method to network, being a member of a professional organization also enhances your résumé.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s02_p02">But don’t just join—get involved. You can impress people with your skills, drive, and work ethic by getting involved in a committee, planning an event, working on the organization’s Web site, or other project. It’s a great way to build your experience and your résumé and impress prospective employers. At the same time, you can be developing professional references to speak on your behalf.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Power Networking Tip #3: Create Your Networking List</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s03_p01">Networking, like selling, is personal. So make a list of all the people you know with whom you can network. Don’t disqualify anyone because you think they can’t help. You never know who knows someone who might be the link to your next job. Follow the same strategy for your personal networking as you would use for networking for selling: write down the four Fs—friends, family, friends’ family, and family’s friends using a format like the example shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s03_t01">Table 3.2 "Sample Networking List"</a>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_060">Howcast, “How to Network,” video, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9VUqB7wQpY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9VUqB7wQpY</a> (accessed July 27, 2009).</span> But don’t stop there; include your manicurist, insurance agent, hairstylist, and anyone else with whom you have a relationship. Don’t forget to visit your school alumni office. It’s always easier to start networking with people with whom you already have a relationship.</p>

If your networking takes place via e-mail, you should do the same thing. When you send your résumé to someone with whom you are networking via e-mail, it’s best to include your three bullet points from your cover letter as the body of the e-mail (review the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a>). That allows the person to whom you are sending the letter to see at a glance that he wants to open your résumé. In most cases the person to whom you are sending your résumé is forwarding it to someone else. Writing a short, easy-to-skim note helps tell every recipient what you have to offer. For example, see <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s04_f01">Figure 3.5 "Sample E-mail for Networking"</a> for a sample e-mail to Chris Reddy.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s05_p01">Social networking sites can be a more powerful job search tool than most people realize, and their power can go both ways: The sites can work in your favor, but they can also work against you. When you’re preparing to apply for jobs, keep in mind that a growing number of employers search social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace to weed out applicants who might not fit with their company culture. In fact, 22 percent of employers claim to use social networking sites when considering potential hires, and of those employers, 34 percent said they chose not to hire a candidate based on the information they had dug up about that person online.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_061">Mike Hargis, “Social Networking Sites Dos and Don’ts,” <em class="emphasis">CNN.com</em>, November 5, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/11/05/cb.social.networking/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/11/05/cb.social.networking/index.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> One human resources manager based in Seattle, says she has turned down an otherwise promising job candidate’s application on a number of occasions after visiting the applicant’s networking profile. “Sometimes there are compromising photos or videos posted out there where anyone can find them,” she says. “When that happens, those applications go right in the trash.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_062">Elizabeth Lee, personal communication, June 26, 2009.</span> You can find out all kinds of things about a person from his MySpace profile that you couldn’t necessarily learn from his cover letter or résumé! As social networking expert Patrice-Anne Rutledge says, before you go on the job market, make sure you “get rid of your digital dirt.” In particular, look through any videos or photographs you may have uploaded to your profile, any Web sites you may have linked to, and any personal information you reveal that may be controversial or reflect on you in a negative light.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_063">Mike Hargis, “Social Networking Sites Dos and Don’ts,” <em class="emphasis">CNN.com</em>, November 5, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/11/05/cb.social.networking/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/11/05/cb.social.networking/index.html</a> (accessed June 25, 2009).</span></p>

LinkedIn is the biggest and most frequently used networking site, but there are a number of others, including Jobster, Ryze, ZoomInfo, and Plaxo, that allow you to create a professional profile and find contacts in your target industry or at target companies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_065">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 134.</span> Although it’s easy to create an account on these sites, you won’t get the full benefit unless you do two things: make the effort to keep your profile up-to-date and make the effort to grow your network. Here are a few social networking tips to keep in mind:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s05_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make yourself stand out</strong>. Think about the skills and qualities that make you unique. What sets you apart as your own distinctive brand? Your online networking profile should reflect this. Don’t just reproduce your résumé; make your profile into your “elevator speech,” highlighting your interests and using power words to describe your experience and talents. Your network profile is searchable on Google, so give some thought to the keywords you use to describe yourself.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_066">Diana Dietzschold Bourgeois, “Six Steps to Harnessing the Power of LinkedIn,” Magic Marketing USA, January 7, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://magicmarketingusa.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/linkedin">http://magicmarketingusa.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/linkedin</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span>
</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Publicize your profile</strong>. LinkedIn allows you to search your e-mail address book for contacts that also have accounts, so you can easily grow your network. You should also be willing to ask people you know in your industry, including professors and mentors, to join your network. These people are well connected and want to see you succeed. In addition, you can start using your LinkedIn profile badge on outgoing e-mails, and, if you have one, on your Web site. When you publicize yourself this way, people will start linking to you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_067">Diana Dietzschold Bourgeois, “Six Steps to Harnessing the Power of LinkedIn,” Magic Marketing USA, January 7, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://magicmarketingusa.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/linkedin">http://magicmarketingusa.wordpress.com/2009/01/07/linkedin</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Many companies and recruiters are accelerating their use of LinkedIn. “We could not believe the candidates we got” from LinkedIn, says Scott Morrison, director of global recruiting programs at software giant Salesforce.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_068">Matthew Boyle, “Enough to Make a Monster Tremble,” BusinessWeek, June 25, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_27/b4138043180664.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_27/b4138043180664.htm</a> (accessed June 25, 2009).</span>
</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask for recommendations</strong>. As you begin to build a professional network online, you can use it the same way you would use a regular social network. Ask people for recommendations of your work and for referrals to new contacts. Maybe a former professor knows the marketing manager at a company where you want to work; ask her to introduce you. Making a request like this can be terrifying at first, but have confidence. Keep in mind that your professors, mentors, and fellow professionals <em class="emphasis">want</em> to help you, and when they can help you, they <em class="emphasis">will</em>. But you won’t get the help if you don’t ask for it.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Join groups</strong>. Start by joining <em class="emphasis">The Power of Selling</em> group on LinkedIn. Sites like LinkedIn have thousands of groups that are specific to interest, location, hobbies, and industry. Join your local professional group—the Chicago Sales and Marketing Executives group, for instance—and join your school’s alumni association. Your alumni group is an extremely important connection to make because people are almost always eager to help their fellow alumni succeed. But don’t stop there; search for other groups that are in the industry you want to pursue. You can just listen to the conversation and then jump in when you feel comfortable.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Create content</strong>. Think about when you are considering making a major purchase. What do you do? You probably conduct research online to determine the pros and cons of each alternative. Employers do the same thing, so be sure your profile is compelling and up-to-date. In addition, use your social networking pages to create content to demonstrate your skills. For example, write a blog and link it to your Facebook page or post tweets on Twitter about a project on which you are working, a topic about which you are passionate, or even your job search. Get people to follow you and engage in the dialogue. Direct them to your personal Web site, samples of your work, or the content you have created. Social networking gives you the opportunity to show and sell with content that you create.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Search the social networking job boards</strong>. More and more employers are using professional social networking sites to post jobs and seek out prospective employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn03_069">Matthew Boyle, “Enough to Make a Monster Tremble,” BusinessWeek, June 25, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_27/b4138043180664.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/09_27/b4138043180664.htm</a> (accessed June 25, 2009).</span> It’s worth your time to review the job postings using the appropriate keywords.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s06_p01">It might seem like networking doesn’t always work. It’s good to keep in mind that networking is all about exchange of value. Sometimes, you may not find people who want the value you have to offer at the time you are offering it. Don’t be discouraged. Follow-up is important in every part of your job search, so follow up with everyone with whom you network. Sometimes, people are simply distracted or overwhelmed at the time you first contacted them. Or sometimes their situation has changed, even in just a few days; you won’t know this unless you follow up.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s06_p02">It’s best to follow up by phone within one week of a contact. It may seem easier to follow up by e-mail, but you increase your likelihood of being successful and building a relationship when you follow up by phone. Don’t simply leave a voice mail message as it is unlikely that someone will return your call. Continue to call until your contact answers the phone, or leave a voice mail and tell her when you will call back along with your e-mail address. Then, call back when you say you will. You will be pleasantly surprised at the results.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch03_s03_s01_s06_p03">Keep in mind that networking is an ongoing process, whether you are looking for a job or not. When you establish a relationship with someone, keep in touch with her. You should touch base with people in your network at least once every four to six weeks. It’s good to call to catch up, but an e-mail can be just as powerful. Send a link to an article or video that you think she will like. It’s a perfect reason for keeping in touch and helps establish you as someone who delivers value, even when you are not looking for something.</p>

                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Networking</strong> is about exchanging value, not collecting business cards. It’s best to begin networking even before you are looking for a job so you can get to know people and provide value to them; it will help you when you begin your job search.</li>
                    <li>Always network with confidence. You are not asking for a favor—you are simply tapping into a reciprocal business practice.</li>
                    <li>It’s a good idea to create a networking list including friends, family, family’s friends, friends’ family, and everyone else you know. Write down their names and contact information so you don’t miss anyone.</li>
                    <li>Practice what you want to say when you network with people. It’s best to be specific about what you are looking for and always ask for another person with whom you can network.</li>
                    <li>Online professional social networks such as LinkedIn, Plaxo, and other networking sites including Facebook and Twitter can help you expand your network and build relationships with many people who might be able to help put you in touch with the right people.</li>
                    <li>Your social networking pages represent your personal brand. Be sure that all words, pictures, and videos are appropriate for prospective employers to view.</li>
                    <li>Follow-up is the key to making networking work; don’t assume that because you haven’t heard back from someone that he doesn’t want to talk to you. Take the time to follow up within one week of every contact.</li>

            <li>Consultative selling occurs when you develop a one-to-one relationship with your customer and truly understand his needs, wants, and resources; it means putting the customer first. Consultative selling helps you develop short-term and long-term solutions for your customer. Transactional selling focuses on a single transaction with no input from or relationship with the customer.</li>
            <li>Lifetime value means that you consider not just one transaction with a customer but also the help and insight you can provide throughout the entire period that you do business with him. A customer that has only limited needs right now may develop into a lucrative customer over the course of time based on your advice and guidance.</li>
            <li>It’s best to deliver bad news in person or over the phone when time permits. This tells your customer that you think this is important. You should always communicate in an open, honest, and timely manner and provide a realistic solution to the problem. If you don’t have a solution, let the customer know when you will get back to her with an update.</li>
            <li>The customer, you, and your company all win in a win-win-win relationship.</li>
            <li>Networking is the art of building alliances or mutually beneficial relationships. Networking is built on the concept of exchange. In selling, you can expand the number of people you know, which can expand your business. When what you need provides value to someone else in your network, networking works. The more you provide value to other people, the higher the likelihood that they will go out of their way to help you.</li>
            <li>Adaptive selling occurs when a salesperson adapts and customizes her selling style based on the behavior of the customer. If you adapt to the customer’s social style, you can increase the chances that he will be open to hearing your message.</li>
            <li>Be professional; focus on facts and timelines that will allow your customer to see how quickly she can achieve her goal. Provide options that allow her to be in control.</li>
            <li>Create a networking list, join professional organizations, use online professional social networks, publicize your profile, ask for recommendations, join groups, create content, and follow up.</li>
