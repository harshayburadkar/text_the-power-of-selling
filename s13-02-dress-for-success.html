    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s02_p02">Tom Reilly tells the story of a salesperson that showed up to one of his recent seminars dressed in flip-flops and a T-shirt. “I thought he was there to clean the windows,” Reilly says.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_009">Tom Reilly, “Dress for Success,” Tom Reilly Training, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomreillytraining.com/Ezine%207-07%20DressforSuccess.htm">http://www.tomreillytraining.com/Ezine%207-07%20DressforSuccess.htm</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> You want your prospective customers to take you seriously at first glance, so pay careful attention to what you wear on your sales call. Think about it this way, when you are buying a product off the shelf in a store, isn’t packaging the first thing that catches your attention? Marketers know that packaging can influence a consumer’s decision to buy before she ever even researches the product or reads about its features. In the same way, your prospect will make a judgment about you based on the way you “package” yourself; a professionally dressed salesperson can have a huge influence on a prospect’s perception of him, his company, and the product he represents.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_010">“Dress for Success,” Sales Success Blog, November 29, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://salesuccess.blogspot.com/2006/11/dress-for-success.html">http://salesuccess.blogspot.com/2006/11/dress-for-success.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Your appearance should convey professionalism, competence, and success. Most important, regardless of the dress code at your prospect’s business, be sure your appearance includes a smile. A smile is an instant rapport builder. No one wants to buy from someone who isn’t excited about the company or product he’s representing. Show your prospect that this isn’t just a job; it’s a passion.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p01">For most of your business-to-business (B2B) sales situations, business attire will be the norm. For a while in the ’90s there was a trend toward more casual clothing in the workplace, but that trend is mostly on the way out. “I see a return to more traditional business wear,” says Gary Brody, president of the Marcraft Apparel Group.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_013">Paul Burnham Finney, “Redefining Business Casual,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 23, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C 1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> For that matter, even if your customer says business casual is the standard in his workplace, if you are aiming to dress a notch up from that standard, you might decide that business attire is the way to go. As Mark-Evan Blackman of the Fashion Institute of Technology says, suits “universally project an air of authority.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_014">Paul Burnham Finney, “Redefining Business Casual,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 23, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C 1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s02_s01_s01_p02">For men, business attire means a suit (matching pants and jacket), a necktie, a long-sleeved shirt, and lace-up shoes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_015">Andy Gilchrist, “Cracking the Dress Code,” Ask Andy about Clothes, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/Clothes%20Articles/cracking_the_dress_code.htm">http://www.askandyaboutclothes.com/Clothes%20Articles/cracking_the_dress_code.htm</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Go for conservative, dark colors such as gray, black, or dark blue for the suit; white or light blue for the shirt. For women, business means a suit (skirt or pants and matching jacket), shoes with moderate heels in a basic pump style (closed-toe), a blouse, and tan or light pantyhose.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s02_s01_s02_p01">Business casual can sometimes be tricky because it’s less clearly defined than business attire. According to Monster.com, business casual “means dressing professionally, looking relaxed, yet neat and pulled together.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650812">Paul Burnham Finney, “Redefining Business Casual,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 23, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C 1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> For men, a bare minimum approach to business casual means dress pants and a collared shirt. Women can wear skirts or pants, but skirts should be a conservative length, and pants should be well tailored: not too tight or too loose. On the top, a blouse or a tailored knit sweater are good choices, and for footwear, make sure to wear closed-toe shoes.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650827">Virginia Tech University Career Services, “Business Casual Attire,” Virginia Tech University, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.career.vt.edu/Jobsearc/BusCasual.htm">http://www.career.vt.edu/Jobsearc/BusCasual.htm</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Business casual for men or women does <em class="emphasis">not</em> include workout clothes or shoes, wrinkled clothing, worn blue jeans, shorts, miniskirts, athletic socks, or overly revealing clothing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650841">Paul Burnham Finney, “Redefining Business Casual,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 23, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405EEDD1F39F930A15753C 1A9619C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <li>All clothes should be cleaned and pressed. Wrinkled or stained clothing looks very unprofessional. Take the time to review your wardrobe days before your presentation to be sure everything is cleaned and pressed. A trip to the dry cleaner is money well spent.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s02_s03_p01">When employees whose businesses rent space in the Coca-Cola building on New York’s Fifth Avenue want to bring a canned or bottled beverage to work, they have a list of drinks to choose from. Vermont Pure Water is OK, but Evian is definitely out. Food and drink orders coming into the building are scanned, and anything with non-Coca-Cola brand products gets sent away.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_023">BNET Advertising Industry, “Adds New Meaning to ‘Always Coca-Cola,’” BNET, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_12_40/ai_54233838">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BDW/is_12_40/ai_54233838</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> While this rule is on the extreme side, it’s true that even the products you use reflect an image, and when you’re doing business with a potential customer, you want that image to be the right one. This is something worth researching before you go into your sales call. If you know who your prospect’s customers are, use those company’s products. Does the prospect do advertising for Apple? Don’t listen to your Zune while you’re waiting for the appointment. If your prospect is a publishing house, read some of their books before you go to your meeting. If they have a radio station or record label, listen to it. Knowing the prospect’s products, or their customers’ products, is part of your credibility.</p>
