    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_p02">Of course, that isn’t the whole story. The MP3s you downloaded have value—that’s why you wanted them, right? And when you take something of value without paying the price, well, that’s theft. The fact that you’re unlikely to get caught (and it isn’t impossible; people are arrested, prosecuted, and ordered to pay massive judgments for providing or downloading music illegally) may make you feel safer, but if you are caught, you could pay from $750 to $150,000 per song.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_001">Elianne Friend, “Woman Fined to Tune of $1.9 Million for Illegal Downloads,” <em class="emphasis">CNN.com</em>, June 18, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/18/minnesota.music.download.fine/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/18/minnesota.music.download.fine/index.html</a> (accessed February 13, 2010).</span> Other variables can further complicate the situation.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Ethics comes into play in the decisions you make every day. Have you ever received too much money back when you paid for something in a store, didn’t get charged for something you ordered at a restaurant, or called in sick to work when you just wanted a day off?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_005">College Confidential, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-institute-technology/427749-ethical-dilemma-question.html">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-institute-technology/427749-ethical-dilemma-question.html</a> (accessed August 31, 2009).</span> Each of these is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethical dilemma</a><span class="glossdef">A situation in which options are presented which may be right or wrong.</span></span>. You make your decision about which path to take based on your personal ethics; your actions reflect your own moral beliefs and moral conduct.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_006">Manual Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, and Michael J. Meyer, “What Is Ethics?” Santa Clara University, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/whatisethics.html">http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/whatisethics.html</a> (accessed August 31, 2009).</span> Your ethics are developed as a result of your family, church, school, community, and other influences that help shape your personal beliefs—that which you believe to be right versus wrong.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_007">Manual Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, and Michael J. Meyer, “Ethics and Virtue,” Santa Clara University, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/ethicsandvirtue.html">http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/ethicsandvirtue.html</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span> A good starting point for your personal ethics is the golden rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” That is, treat people the way that you would like to be treated. You would like people to be honest with you, so be honest with others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p02">Your strong sense of personal ethics can help guide you in your decisions. You might be surprised to find yourself with an ethical dilemma about something that is second nature to you. For example, imagine that you’re taking a class (required for your major) that has an assignment of a twenty-page paper and you’ve been so busy with your classes, internship, and volunteer work that you really haven’t had the time to get started. You know you shouldn’t have waited so long and you’re really worried because the paper is due in only two days and you’ve never written a paper this long before. Now you have to decide what to do. You could knuckle down, go to the library, and visit the campus Writing Center, but you really don’t have the time to do all that and still write the entire twenty pages. You’ve heard about some people who have successfully bought papers from this one Web site. You’ve never done it before, but you are really desperate and out of time. “If I only do it this one time,” you think, “I’ll never do it again.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p03">But compromising your ethics even just once is a slippery slope. The idea is that one thing leads naturally to allowing another until you find yourself sliding rapidly downhill. Ethics is all about the art of navigating the slippery slope: you have to draw a line for yourself, decide what you will and won’t do—and then stick to it. If you don’t have a strong set of ethics, you have nothing to use as a guidepost when you are in a situation that challenges you morally. A highly developed set of personal ethics should guide your actions. The only way to develop a strong sense of ethics is to do what you believe in, to take actions consistent with your principles time and time again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p04">So if you buy the paper and get caught, you will not only fail the class, but you may also find yourself expelled from school. If you’re tempted to consider buying a paper, take a minute to read your school’s academic dishonesty policy, as it is most likely very clear about what is right and wrong in situations like this.</p>

Southern Illinois University (SIU) had three high-ranking officials—a university president and two chancellors—revealed as plagiarists in a two-year period.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650541">Margaret Soltan, “Southern Illinois University an Official Laughingstock,” <em class="emphasis">Inside Higher Ed</em>, August 30, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/university_diaries/southern_illinois_university_an_official_laughingstock">http://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/university_diaries/southern_illinois_university_an_official_laughingstock</a> (accessed February 18, 2010).</span> Even more embarrassing, the committee formed to investigate the charges of plagiarism against Chancellor Walter Wendler developed a new plagiarism policy whose parts were plagiarized—specifically, it copied its academic dishonesty policy from Indiana University without citing that source.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650556">Wendy Weinhold, “SIU Accused of Copying Plagiarism Policy,” <em class="emphasis">Daily Egyptian</em>, January 29, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://web2.collegepublisher.com/se/daily-egyptian/siu-accused-of-copying-plagiarism-policy-1.1318397">http://web2.collegepublisher.com/se/daily-egyptian/siu-accused-of-copying-plagiarism-policy-1.1318397</a> (accessed February 18, 2010).</span> SIU was made a laughingstock, and its reputation has suffered considerably.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p03">You have no doubt heard the expression “Do the right thing.” It is the essence of ethics: choosing to do the right thing when you have a choice of actions. Being ethical means you will do the right thing regardless of whether there are possible consequences—you treat other people well and behave morally for its own sake, not because you are afraid of the possible consequences. Simply put, people do the right thing because it is the right thing to do. Thomas Jefferson summed up ethics in a letter he wrote to Peter Carr in 1785: “Whenever you are to do a thing, though it can never be known but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act were all the world looking at you, and act accordingly.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_012">Gerhard Gschwandtner, “Lies and Deception in Selling: How to Tell When Customers or Prospects Are Lying to You,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 15, no. 9, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=4256">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=4256</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p04">Ethical decisions are not always easy to make, depending on the situation. There are some gray areas depending on how you approach a certain situation. According to Sharon Keane, associate director of marketing at the University of Notre Dame, people have different approaches, so there may be multiple solutions to each ethical dilemma,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_013">“An Education in Ethics,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, April 17, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=197">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=197</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> and every situation may have multiple options. For example, if one of your best friends told you in confidence that he stole the questions to the final exam would you say nothing, use them, or report him? Certainly, using the questions would not be ethical, but your ethical dilemma doesn’t end there. Reporting him would be the right thing to do. But if you didn’t report him, would it be unethical? You might not consider that unethical, but what if you just didn’t say anything—is that still ethical? This is the gray area where your personal ethics come into play. Looking the other way doesn’t help him or you. While you might be concerned about jeopardizing your friendship, it would be a small price to pay compared with jeopardizing your personal ethics.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s03_s01_p01">While ethical behavior may seem as if it is the normal course of business, it’s unfortunate that some business people and some businesses do not operate ethically. Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, HealthSouth, and Lehman Brothers among other companies, have been highlighted in the news during the past several years due to unethical behavior that resulted in corporate scandals and, in some cases, the conviction of senior executives and collapse of some companies. While business has never been immune from unethical behavior, it was the fall of Enron in 2001 that brought unethical business behavior on the part of senior executives to the forefront. Enron began as a traditional energy company in 1985. But when energy markets were deregulated (prices were determined based on the competition rather than being set by the government) in 1996, Enron grew rapidly. The company began to expand to areas such as Internet services and borrowed money to fund the new businesses. The debt made the company look less profitable, so the senior management created partnerships in order to keep the debt off the books. In other words, they created “paper companies” that held the debt, and they showed a completely different set of financial statements to shareholders (owners of the company) and the government (U.S. Securities Exchange Commission [SEC]). This accounting made Enron look extremely profitable—it appeared to have tripled its profit in two years. As a result, more people bought stock in the company. This lack of disclosure is against the law, as publicly traded companies are required to disclose accurate financial statements to shareholders and the SEC. There began to be speculation about the accuracy of Enron’s accounting, and on October 16, 2001, the company announced a loss of $638 million. On October 22 of that year, the SEC announced that Enron was under investigation. The stock price continued to fall, and the company was unable to repay its commitments to its shareholders. As a result of this unethical and illegal behavior on the part of senior management, the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_016">NewsHour Extra, “What Happened to Enron?” Paul Solman, PBS, January 22, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june02/enron_past.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june02/enron_past.html</a> (accessed December 6, 2009).</span> The unethical (and illegal) behavior of the senior management team caused a ripple effect that resulted in many innocent people losing their money and their jobs. As a result of the Enron scandal, a new law named the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sarbanes-Oxley Act</a><span class="glossdef">Regulation of corporate financial practices and protection for people who report violations.</span></span> (for Senator Paul Sarbanes from Maryland and Representative Michael Oxley from Ohio) was enacted in 2002 that requires tighter financial reporting controls for publicly traded companies.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_017">SearchCIO, “Sarbanes-Oxley Act,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://searchcio.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid182_gci920030,00.html">http://searchcio.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid182_gci920030,00.html</a> (accessed December 6, 2009).</span></p>

For years, he reported extremely high returns on his clients’ investments, encouraging them to reinvest with even more money. All the time he was stealing from his clients and spending the money. He cheated many clients, including high-profile celebrities like actor Kevin Bacon and his wife Kyra Sedgewick and a charity of Steven Spielberg’s.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_018">“Bernie Madoff Ponzi Scheme: Victim List Grows,” <em class="emphasis">Huffington Post</em>, December 15, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/15/bernie-madoff-ponzi-schem_n_151018.html">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/12/15/bernie-madoff-ponzi-schem_n_151018.html</a> (accessed December 6, 2009).</span> He was arrested, tried, and sentenced to 150 years in jail, and his key employees were also sentenced to similar terms.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_019">Julie Creswell and Landon Thomas Jr., “The Talented Mr. Madoff,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 24, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/business/25bernie.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/business/25bernie.html</a> (accessed August 31, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_020">Jack Healy and Diana B.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethical Dilemmas in Business</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s03_s02_p01">Not all behavior that is unethical is illegal. Companies frequently are faced with ethical dilemmas that are not necessarily illegal but are just as important to navigate. For example, if a travel company wants to attract a lot of new customers, it can honestly state the price of a trip to Disney World in its advertising and let customers decide if they want to purchase the trip. This would be ethical behavior. However, if the company advertises a free vacation in order to get customers to call, but the free vacation package includes a $500 booking fee, it is unethical. Or if an appliance store wants to get new customers by advertising a low-priced refrigerator, it is an ethical way to let customers know that the company has competitively priced appliances as well. However, if the store only has a higher-priced refrigerator in stock and tries to sell that one instead, it is unethical behavior.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s03_s02_p02">Sometimes ethical behavior can be a matter of disclosure, as in the case of Enron, Bernie Madoff, or the examples above. Business ethics can also be challenged based on business practices. For example, in the 1990s Nike was accused of exploiting workers in third-world countries to manufacture their products. The low wages they were paying the workers made Nike’s profits higher.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_021">Aaron Bernstein, “Nike’s New Game Plan for Sweatshops,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, September 20, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_38/b3900011_mz001.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_38/b3900011_mz001.htm</a> (accessed December 6, 2009).</span> While this is not illegal behavior—they were paying the workers—it was considered unethical because they were paying the workers less than what is reasonable. Another example of unethical behavior is not disclosing information. For example, if a car salesperson knows that a used car he is selling has been in an accident but says that it has not been involved in an accident, that is unethical. Bribing an executive, saying or promising things that are knowingly untrue, or treating employees unfairly are all examples of unethical behavior in business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s04_p01">You may choose to shop at companies because of their business practices. For example, you might like The Body Shop because of its commitment to selling products that do not use animals for testing. This is a case of ethical behavior that is socially responsible. In fact, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">corporate social responsibility (CSR)</a><span class="glossdef">Company actions that balance the interests of all stakeholders.</span></span> is when companies operate in a way that balances the interests of all stakeholders including employees, customers, investors, vendors, the community, society, and any other parties that have a stake in the company. While corporate social responsibility may seem easy, it’s not always as easy as it looks. Keep in mind that in order to be socially responsible a company has to balance the social, economic, and environmental dimensions, which means generating a profit for investors while serving the best interest of all parties that have a stake in the operations of the company. When companies measure the impact of their performance along the three dimensions of social, economic, and environmental impact, it is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">triple bottom line</a><span class="glossdef">Measurement of company performance along three dimensions—social, economic, and environmental.</span></span>.

It’s no surprise that companies that consistently demonstrate ethical behavior and social responsibility generate better results.

It is times like these that can challenge many companies that do not have this kind of ethical commitment. With pressure on short-term results, many companies set unrealistic goals and employees feel extreme pressure to meet them or face the possibility of losing their jobs. Professor Neil Malhotra of the Stanford Graduate School of Business calls this an “overemphasis on instant gratification.” In fact, he feels that is the root cause of the current economic crisis.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_024">Jeremy Dann, “Business Ethics integral to Corporate Strategy, Says Stanford’s Malhotra,” BNET, July 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/mba/?p=927&amp;tag=content;col1">http://blogs.bnet.com/mba/?p=927&amp;tag=content;col1</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span> But business ethics, just like personal ethics, mean doing the right thing even when it is a difficult choice or doesn’t appear to be advantageous.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s07_p01">Ethics and values are major concepts. If you have developed personal ethics and values, you might be wondering how they come together to help provide a roadmap for your life and your career. That’s the purpose of your mission statement; it becomes your roadmap for your decisions, choices, and behavior. You learned about creating your personal mission statement in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s07_p02">Just as your personal mission statement is a blueprint for how you make decisions in life, companies also use a mission statement to define their direction, make operating decisions, and communicate to employees, vendors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In fact, most companies have a formal, written mission that they include on their Web site. A mission statement is different than an advertising slogan or motto. It is based on the company’s ethics and values and provides a broad direction as to what the company stands for. For example, Harley-Davidson’s mission statement is below and can be found on their Web site.</p>

The mission statement is made available for the following reasons: employees can use it to aid them in ethical business decision making, investors can evaluate the company’s ethics before making a decision about becoming involved with it, and customers can choose whom they will do business with based on their ethics and purpose. In addition to their mission statement (which you may remember from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>: “Google’s mission is to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_044">Google, “Corporate Information: Company Overview,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/corporate">http://www.google.com/corporate</a> (accessed September 1, 2009).</span>), Google’s Web site gives their philosophy—ten guiding principles, ten “things Google has found to be true,” which are values that reflect how the company conducts business:</p>

Knowing how important a game’s reputation can be for sales, public relations firm Barrington Harvey—in an attempt to massage the Metacritic score, a less-than-ethical move—asked reviewers to hold their scores until after the first weekend of the game’s release. “That’s right. We’re trying to manage the review scores at the request of Eidos.” When asked why, a spokesperson for Barrington Harvey explained, “Just that we’re trying to get the Metacritic rating to be high, and the brand manager in the United States that’s handling all of Tomb Raider has asked that we just manage the scores before the game is out, really, just to ensure that we don’t put people off buying the game, basically.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_048">Mike Fahey, “Eidos Trying to Fix Tomb Raider: Underworld Metacritic Scores,” Kotaku, November 21, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://kotaku.com/5095674/eidos-trying-to-fix-tomb-raider-underworld-metacritic-scores">http://kotaku.com/5095674/eidos-trying-to-fix-tomb-raider-underworld-metacritic-scores</a> (accessed September 1, 2009).</span> Eidos, the company that published the game, tried to take an ethical shortcut—they wanted to be sure that the game’s reputation <em class="emphasis">could not</em> precede it—but paid for that decision with a great deal of negative publicity that adversely impacted their reputation.</p>

Both had stellar reputations and were considered role models. Now both are working to gain back the trust of the public. Reputation isn’t limited to the wealthy or powerful. In high school, you knew that Sharon was a brain and Timothy was the sensitive, poetic type. You may never have had a conversation with either one of them, but you knew their reputations. Meanwhile, you avoided classes with Mrs. Avar because she had a reputation as a hard grader. Your reactions to many of the people in your day-to-day life are affected by their reputations.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s09_p03">A great way to build your reputation in a specific industry is to become an industry expert: write a blog, tweet regularly about industry issues, be a guest speaker or panelist at industry conferences or events online or in person. Decision makers hear and see you take on a leadership role and seek you out to gain your expertise. You can build your reputation, which, in turn, will help you build your client list.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_050">Renee Houston Zemanski, “The Power of Your Reputation,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP1900197">http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP1900197</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s09_p04">When you work in sales, you are selling yourself; you will have greater success with customers if you are someone they want to “buy.” When customers buy from you, they are investing in your reputation. George Ludwig, author of <em class="emphasis">Power Selling</em>, explains that “you’ve got to live out your identity consistently in every facet of your life and make sure prospective clients bump into that identity everywhere they turn.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_051">Renee Houston Zemanski, “The Power of Your Reputation,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP1900197">http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP1900197</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span> In other words, every action you take affects your reputation. If you fail to follow up, forget details, or even if you are consistently late for meetings, you may become known as unreliable. On the other hand, if you consistently deliver what you promise, you will be known as reliable; if you always meet your deadlines, you will have a reputation for punctuality.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s09_p05">Robert L. Bailey, retired CEO, president, and chairman of the State Auto Insurance Companies, knows how important a salesperson’s reputation can be and the value of consistent ethical behavior. “Back in my corporate days I regularly met with new employees. I would tell them, ‘Regardless of the circumstances, regardless of what the contract says, we always want you to do the right thing. Do you know what it means to do the right thing?’ I would ask.” Bailey knows that any action taken by a salesperson can affect his or her reputation: “If your actions are described on the front page of our local newspaper or <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, will most people read the account and say, ‘I think they did the right thing?” That’s the kind of action we encourage and expect.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_052">Robert L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s10_p01">Unfortunately, not everyone in sales is ethical or honest. David Chittock, president of Incentra, Inc., discusses one encounter in which a customer shared her view of salespeople: “The prospect’s body language told me she wasn’t just uncomfortable—she was downright hostile to me. Finally, she shared this sentiment out loud: ‘I have to be honest with you. I think that all salespeople are liars, and I don’t trust any of them, and I don’t trust you.’” He goes on to explain that “many (if not all) of our prospects, view salespeople with suspicion, assuming that in attempting to make a sale, we will be self-serving, manipulative, and possibly even untruthful.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_053">David Chittock, “Outside the Box: A Question of Integrity,” Manage Smarter, May 28, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.presentations.com/msg/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003977677">http://www.presentations.com/msg/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003977677</a> (accessed February 18, 2010).</span> Chittock and his employees overcome that suspicion by making promises to their customers and then keeping them—sure, it sounds simple, but too many salespeople are willing to promise their customers the moon in order to close the deal.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s10_p03">If you are committed to finding win-win-win solutions for your customers, you need to be honest with them and with yourself. Figure out what you can realistically guarantee, make the promise, and then keep it. Jack Welch, in his book <em class="emphasis">Winning</em>, declares that “too many people—too often—instinctively don’t express themselves with frankness. They don’t communicate straightforwardly or put forth ideas looking to stimulate real debate. But when you’ve got candor, everything just operates faster and better.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_055">John C. Maxwell, <em class="emphasis">There’s No Such Thing as “Business</em>” <em class="emphasis">Ethics</em> (New York: Center Street, 2003).</span> If circumstances change and you realize that you will be unable to keep your promise, immediately communicate with the customer; explain what has happened, offer a new solution, and apologize. While that can make for an awkward conversation, in the long run, that kind of honesty and openness will help you to build strong business relationships.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p01">Imagine that you are the buyer for Chez Food, a popular pan-European restaurant on the West Coast. You have good relationships with your suppliers, especially your produce guy, a genial fellow who owns his own business. As the holidays approach, Ray, your produce guy, approaches you with a gift. He tells you that he really appreciates both your business and your friendship, and he hands you two tickets to a Caribbean cruise. The company policy is clear: you aren’t supposed to accept gifts from suppliers, but, you argue to yourself, what could be the harm? After all, you were planning to keep buying from Ray before he offered you the tickets; it’s not as though he’s asking you for anything, anyway. What will you do? Your ethical obligation, of course, is to refuse the tickets—politely. Your relationship with Ray is important, but doing the right thing—and keeping your job—is important too.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p02">At some point in your selling career—in fact, probably at many points—you will be faced with a situation that challenges your ethics. At these times, it is best to follow your code of ethics and the company’s code of ethics; when in doubt, don’t make an exception. If you’re having trouble finding the motivation to refuse a gift or accurately detail your résumé, remember that you will very like be found out—and when you’re found out, you will be very lucky not to lose your job. Is the case of wine from a supplier worth losing your job over? But more important, when you fail an ethical challenge, you trade in your integrity. If you are tempted to inflate your expense report by fifty dollars, ask yourself, “Is my integrity worth more than fifty dollars?” The answer, of course, is that your integrity is worth more than any amount of money—and once gone, it cannot be bought back. Ken Lay, former CEO of Enron, was a man with a great reputation and an oil portrait displayed at his alma mater; once his crimes were discovered, however, his name was forever associated with a willingness to break the law and exploit his own employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_056">“Ken Lay’s Final Act,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 6, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/opinion/06thurs4.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/opinion/06thurs4.html</a> (accessed September 1, 2009).</span></p>

Most of them have to operate in the gray a lot of the time…because of the aggressiveness with which the targets are set of the way in which their achievement of those targets is rewarded, intelligent, honest people suddenly think that this act is OK: because within that environment it seems to be OK. It isn’t OK; they’ve actually done something which is illegal or amoral.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_057">Sir Michael Rake, “Setting the Right Tone at the Top,” <em class="emphasis">Leading by Example</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press, 2007), 9–11.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p04">Finding yourself in a corrupt corporate culture is not reason enough to violate your own code of ethics or break the law. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel pressured to do something unethical (or even illegal), talk to your supervisor about it. If you don’t feel that you can talk to your supervisor—or your supervisor is part of the problem—talk to someone in the human resources department. Give the company a chance to resolve the situation; if they are not aware of it, they can’t make it right.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p05">If you’re wondering about how the role of human resources works in a situation like this, it might be helpful to think about an analogy: When you were in high school and you went out with your friends, your mother, at some point or another (or perhaps every Friday night!), must have given you a talk that went something like this: “I want you to have a good time with your friends—but if anything happens, just call us and we’ll come pick you up and we won’t be mad. If there’s drinking at the party, or if someone has drugs, just call us if you need to, OK?” While you probably won’t be calling your mom when an ethical problem arises at work (much as you might secretly like to), you <em class="emphasis">can</em> call the human resources department. Human resources departments oversee hiring, promotions, and performance reviews, but they also deal with employee relations and can provide confidential counseling to workers. It is important for a company’s success that employee goals align with corporate goals; when this is the case, the corporate culture is considered “successful.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_058">David Towers, “An Investigation into Whether Organisational Culture Is Directly Linked to Motivation and Performance through Looking at Google Inc.,” extended essay, The University of Birmingham, The Birmingham Business School, 2005–6, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.towers.fr/essays/culture%20performance%20and%20motivation%20review%20and%20the%20google%20case%20study%20success.pdf">http://www.towers.fr/essays/culture%20performance%20and%20motivation %20review%20and%20the%20google%20case%20study%20success.pdf</a> (accessed September 1, 2009).</span> If your supervisor is involved in the wrongdoing, the human resources department can be an excellent resource for you.</p>
