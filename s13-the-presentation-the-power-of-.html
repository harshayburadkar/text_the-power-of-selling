    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_p01">You’ve made it! After all your hard work you have reached the point in the selling process where the qualifying, researching, and planning stages pay off. Finally, your story and the customer’s story are about to connect in an exciting way. Most salespeople think of the presentation as the best part of the selling process. It’s the opportunity to show the prospect that you know your stuff—and the chance to deliver value by putting your problem solving skills to work. So get ready, visualize the best possible outcome to your sales presentation, and take the necessary steps to make this outcome a reality.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Keep Your Eye on the Prize</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_p01">As excited as you might be about your product, or as eager as you are to demonstrate your solution, keep in mind that your sales presentation is primarily about building a relationship and beginning a partnership, especially in the business-to-business (B2B) arena. When Selena Lo, CEO of Ruckus Wireless, is gearing up for a sales presentation, she focuses her final preparations on making it personal. Lo’s company specializes in wireless routers that handle video, voice, and data capabilities for businesses. When she identifies a prospect, Lo’s first priority is finding the person she refers to as “the fox”: her ally in the prospect company who wants to see technological changes take place in his organization. Lo gives this relationship special attention, often inviting this individual out to dinner before the presentation to win his loyalty and get any additional details about his company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_p02">Several days before the presentation, Lo researches everyone who will be in the meeting. She reads their bios and googles them to find out their employment histories. “You don’t want someone to think you checked out their entire past,” says Lo, but “you try to strike up more links between you and that person.” She prepares the seating arrangement for the sales meeting strategically, making sure that she will be sitting directly across from the highest-ranking person there so that she can make eye contact. On the day of the presentation, she asks a member of her sales team to write down each person’s name when they walk in the door—and to make a point of using the names during the presentation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_001">Stephanie Clifford, “Find the Fox,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, February 1, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070201/features-sales-performance-lo.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070201/features-sales-performance-lo.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Lo’s efforts to give the sales presentation a personal touch are a reminder that in relationship selling, you can never lose sight of the most important thing: your customer. Coach yourself on this on the day of your presentation and keep it in mind in the days leading up to it. What can you do to personalize this presentation and show your customers that it’s all about their organization?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_p03">Taking a customer-centric approach lies at the heart of delivering value. In these terms, value isn’t about offering a good price. It’s not just about solving the customer’s problems either. As Tom Reilly, author of <em class="emphasis">Value-Added Selling: How to Sell More Profitably, Confidently, and Professionally by Competing on Value, Not Price</em>, explains it, delivering value means that you “define value in customer terms, ask questions, listen to customers, and put the spotlight on customer-centric solutions.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_002">Tom Reilly, <em class="emphasis">Value-Added Selling: How to Sell More Profitably, Confidently, and Professionally by Competing on Value, Not Price</em>, 2nd ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2002), 23–24.</span> This might mean that it takes more than one meeting to close your sale; you might need several visits to adequately respond to your customer’s needs. According to one study, “Today’s presentations typically are conducted over several meetings, with the salesperson often doing more listening than talking.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_003">William C. Moncrief and Greg W. Marshall, “The Evolution of the Seven Steps of Selling,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Marketing Management</em> 34, no. 1 (2005): 18.</span> Make it your goal to see that you <em class="emphasis">and</em> your prospect get what you want out of the meeting.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_p04">It’s a good idea to visualize this outcome before going into the meeting. Review your precall objectives. What will it look like to achieve these objectives? What steps will you and your prospect have to take? How will it feel when you both have achieved your goals? This isn’t just about calming your nerves; visualizing the outcome you want is actually a powerful tool to help you achieve that outcome. For one thing, it’s another form of planning. If you mentally run through a “movie” of the sales presentation, allowing yourself to picture your reactions and the steps you will take to close in on your objective, you will be better prepared when the meeting takes place.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_004">Richard White, “Déjà Vu,” Pro Excellence, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pro-excellence.com/html/resources.html">http://www.pro-excellence.com/html/resources.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Each step of the presentation will come naturally to you because you have already mentally rehearsed, and you will be better positioned to sell adaptively because you have already imagined a number of possible scenarios and customer responses.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_p05">For another thing, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mental rehearsal</a><span class="glossdef">Running through a scenario (like your sales presentation) step-by-step in your mind before you go into the situation.</span></span> fools your subconscious mind into believing you have already achieved your goals. Sales trainer and CEO Brian Tracy says, “Your subconscious mind cannot tell the difference between a real experience and one that you vividly imagine,” so if you imagine a successful presentation and its outcome several times before your <em class="emphasis">actual</em> presentation, you will be as calm and confident as if you had already closed the sale. You will smile more easily, you will speak more slowly and clearly, and you will command attention. In addition, if your subconscious mind believes you have already been in this situation before, it will direct you to say and do the things you need to achieve your objective.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_005">Brian Tracy, <em class="emphasis">Advanced Selling Strategies</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1996), 80.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Power to Adapt</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p01">The sales presentation is where adaptive selling makes all the difference. Up until this point, you have researched and prepared and developed a solution that you think will meet your prospect’s needs, but walking into the presentation and delivering on that preparation requires a different set of skills. Among other things, it requires flexibility and the ability to think on your feet. The best salespeople adapt their presentations to their prospect’s reactions, and they go in knowing they may have to adapt to surprises for which they were unable to prepare (maybe the building has a power outage during the slideshow, for instance, or maybe one of the people from the customer organization decides to send another employee in his place at the last minute). These top-performing salespeople know that keeping a customer-centric focus, visualizing a successful outcome, and mentally rehearsing your presentation before you deliver it will give you the power to adapt with confidence and ease.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s01_s01_p02">Adapting is all about listening. As Paul Blake noted in the video ride-along at the beginning of the chapter, your sales presentation is really a compilation of all the listening you have done to this point. And listening doesn’t stop there. It’s impossible to adapt if you’re not listening. When you are creating your presentation, keep in mind that it is not a one-way communication. Presentations are for listening, adapting, and solving problems.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_p01">There’s nothing worse than putting hours into preparing a killer sales presentation, only to blow your chances because you forgot to bring an important part of your demonstration or because you got lost on your way to the meeting. Don’t let disorganization hold you back: take charge of the details so that your only concern on the day of the presentation is the delivery.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01">The evening before your meeting, read over your precall objectives; practice your presentation a number of times out loud; and walk through your mental rehearsal, visualizing success. You can’t practice too many times. The content of your presentation should be second nature by the time you get up in front of your audience so that you can focus your energy on your prospect. Rehearsal is one of the best ways to calm your nerves so that you can focus on delivering your presentation naturally and connecting with your prospect.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p02">Andres Mendes, global CIO of Special Olympics International, says that rehearsing out loud makes him too nervous; he likes to leave room for spontaneity and adaptation. Mendes develops the big themes of the presentation and maps these out into PowerPoint slides that tell the whole story. “I time the slides to move exactly at my pace, so I rehearse the mechanics and make sure those are right,” he says.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_006">Maryfran Johnson, “Rehearsing Success,” <em class="emphasis">CIO Magazine</em>, June 10, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cio.com/article/494729/Why_Even_Successful_Speakers_Need_To_Practice">http://www.cio.com/article/494729/Why_Even_Successful_Speakers_Need_To_Practice</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p04">The bottom line? While nearly all top-performing salespeople rehearse, not all approach rehearsal in the same way. Find the style of rehearsal that works best for you. Additionally, don’t let your rehearsal lock you into delivering a rigidly defined set of remarks. You have to leave room for flexibility and adaptation.</p>
            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p05">The night before, you should also get together all the materials you’ll need for your presentation—handouts, files, product samples, and contracts—and have them ready to go for the following morning. This will save you time tracking down loose supplies at the last minute, when you’re trying to get out the door to make it to your meeting. It’s also a good idea to set out your clothes the night before for the same reason.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p06">If you are planning to use multimedia equipment in your presentation, make sure in advance that your prospect will have everything you’ll need to make it run. If you aren’t sure, bring everything (e.g., cables, adapters, remotes) with you. And of course, make sure you know how to use all your equipment. When Keith Waldon, CEO of Earth Preserv, was preparing for a meeting with JCPenney, one of his biggest prospects, he spent hours rehearsing with his multimedia equipment. The technology was a key element of his presentation, and he wanted to make sure everything would work perfectly for the big day. “I had to learn how to use all the remote-control equipment,” he says. Waldon also brought a technical assistant with him as backup to safeguard against any glitches.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_008">Susan Greco, “Anatomy of a Launch: The Five-Hour Multimedia Sales Presentation,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, October 1, 1995, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19951001/2441.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19951001/2441.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Getting There</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p01">It might surprise you to know how often salespeople show up late to their own presentations because they get lost on the way to the meeting. When you are traveling to an unfamiliar place for your appointment, get directions in advance, and allow extra travel time in case of traffic delays or wrong turns. Make sure you also research the parking situation beforehand. If your prospect is a large corporation with its own complex, are there reserved employee lots and visitor lots? Will you have to walk a considerable distance from your car to the meeting room? If you’ll be meeting in an urban area, is street parking available, or will you have to find a parking garage? You don’t want to arrive on time only to get delayed because you spent twenty minutes driving around in search of a parking spot. It’s a good idea to make a “test” trip in advance of your meeting. That will help avoid surprises with traffic, parking, security, or other areas that might cause a delay. If something unavoidable <em class="emphasis">does</em> come up to set you back, make sure you call ahead to let your customer know you will be arriving late.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p02">Besides the extra time you allow for travel, plan to arrive at the meeting a little early. Not only does this convey professionalism, but it also gives you the time to mentally prepare once you arrive and to set up any equipment you’ll be using. It’s a good idea to allow time to stop in the restroom and take one last look to be sure you’re at your best (and it’s a good time to use a breath mint). Finally, bring something to read in case you have to wait: a business magazine, a newspaper like the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, or maybe a Kindle.</p>

Think about it this way, when you are buying a product off the shelf in a store, isn’t packaging the first thing that catches your attention? Marketers know that packaging can influence a consumer’s decision to buy before she ever even researches the product or reads about its features. In the same way, your prospect will make a judgment about you based on the way you “package” yourself; a professionally dressed salesperson can have a huge influence on a prospect’s perception of him, his company, and the product he represents.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_010">“Dress for Success,” Sales Success Blog, November 29, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://salesuccess.blogspot.com/2006/11/dress-for-success.html">http://salesuccess.blogspot.com/2006/11/dress-for-success.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Your appearance should convey professionalism, competence, and success.

Vermont Pure Water is OK, but Evian is definitely out.

This is something worth researching before you go into your sales call. If you know who your prospect’s customers are, use those company’s products. Does the prospect do advertising for Apple? Don’t listen to your Zune while you’re waiting for the appointment. If your prospect is a publishing house, read some of their books before you go to your meeting. If they have a radio station or record label, listen to it. Knowing the prospect’s products, or their customers’ products, is part of your credibility.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_p01">A good salesperson can read group dynamics as skillfully as she can read an individual prospect’s verbal and nonverbal cues and is comfortable in one-on-one and in group presentation situations. This is critical because as a salesperson sometimes you have control over the kind of presentation you will deliver (group versus individual), but in many situations, the size of the audience to which you will present is determined by the needs and structure of your prospect’s organization. In many organizations large purchasing decisions are the responsibility of purchasing committees or of a combination of individual and group decision makers.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_024">Gary M. Grikscheit, Harold C. Cash, and Clifford E. Young, <em class="emphasis">The Handbook of Selling: Psychological, Managerial, and Marketing Dynamics</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 1993), 152.</span> You might find that you begin with several individual presentations to decision makers in an organization and then are asked to give a follow-up group presentation to a purchasing committee.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting to Individuals</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s01_p01">In one-on-one presentations, of course, you only have one person’s needs, preferences, and background to research and adapt to, so customization is usually an easy task. You can closely observe your prospect’s nonverbal communication and listen to her stated needs and concerns and respond accordingly. Does he look worried when you tell him that your company’s integrated marketing plan usually takes four months to develop? You can explain that for preferred prospects you are sometimes able to turn around a faster solution. Does he seem distracted when you begin discussing product features? You can back off and begin asking more questions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s01_p02">As you learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a> in the discussion about social styles, you will be in a better position to deliver value during your sales presentation if you know something about your buyer’s personality before going into the meeting: Is your prospect conversational and people oriented, or is he task oriented and businesslike? Does your prospect care about details and thorough descriptions, or does he prefer to see the “big picture”? Is he competitive? How does he feel about change? Understanding these things about your prospect will help you to favorably position your product and plan your presentation so that you can put emphasis on the things that matter most to the individual. If you know your prospect is highly competitive, for instance, he will probably be interested in learning about the features that set your product apart from others on the market and the ways in which your product can give him or his company a competitive edge.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s01_p03">Writing up a customer trait description before your meeting can be very helpful so that you can use the information as a guideline in preparing your presentation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_025">Gary M. Grikscheit, Harold C. Cash, and Clifford E. Young, <em class="emphasis">The Handbook of Selling: Psychological, Managerial, and Marketing Dynamics</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 1993), 127.</span> If you’re working with an existing customer or if you’ve interacted with your prospect prior to the presentation, you can use your observations to write a trait description. If you haven’t met the prospect before, try asking other salespeople in your organization, noncompetitive salespeople at other companies, or other contacts you have who might have met your prospect and who can tell you something about her personality.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_026">Gary M. Grikscheit, Harold C. Cash, and Clifford E. Young, <em class="emphasis">The Handbook of Selling: Psychological, Managerial, and Marketing Dynamics</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 1993), 136.</span> Also, use the company resources including the CRM system to gather as much information as possible about the company and your contact. In addition, it is also a good idea to send a precall questionnaire to your contact to gather information such as the names and titles of the people who will be attending the presentation, how much time has been allotted for you, objectives for the meeting, and any other information that will help you plan the meeting. This information can provide valuable information and help you create an agenda, which is a good idea to send to the prospect before the meeting.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting to Groups</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s02_p01">If customization is that straightforward with an individual buyer, why would you ever choose to sell to a group? Besides the fact that sometimes the nature of the sale demands it, selling to groups is also more efficient than selling to individuals. If you’re selling accounting software to a number of departments in an organization, rather than meeting individually with a decision maker from each department, you can save time by giving your sales presentation to a number of decision makers at once. Group presentations can also help you identify the decision makers in an organization if you aren’t yet sure who they are. By keeping an eye on group dynamics during the presentation you can usually observe the “pecking order” among members and identify the individuals in the group whose opinions hold the most leverage.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s02_p02">Additionally, group presentations can be a way to win greater support for your sale. If you know one or two people in an organization who are excited about your product, you can allow their enthusiasm to influence others in a group setting.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_030">Gary M. Grikscheit, Harold C. Cash, and Clifford E. Young, <em class="emphasis">The Handbook of Selling: Psychological, Managerial, and Marketing Dynamics</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 1993), 165.</span> Recall Selena Lo of Ruckus Wireless, who finds the “fox” within each of her target organizations and leverages his support of her product to sway the group buying decision.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s02_p03">If you know what is at stake for each member of the group, you will be able to facilitate the discussion during your presentation much more effectively. This is why it’s important to gather information about everyone who will attend your sales meeting. Again, think of Lo’s method, where she reads each group member’s bio and googles their names before going into a group meeting. Find out the individual’s needs within the organization. What is her status? How does she perceive the urgency of the problem you want to solve? Does she have any ego involvement in the product or service?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_031">Barton A. Weitz, Stephen Byron Castleberry, and John F. Tanner, <em class="emphasis">Selling: Building Partnerships</em>, 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003), 264.</span> (For instance, an accountant in the organization might feel threatened by new accounting software if it replaces part of her current role.) This will help you understand the most important concerns you will need to address in the presentation, and if certain parts of your presentation apply more directly to certain members of the group, you can direct those parts specifically at those individuals.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s02_p04">Keep in mind that people act differently in group settings than they do when you are interacting with them alone, so finding out about individual members’ personalities is less important in group presentations. Instead, adjust your presentation to the dynamics in the room. Watch the group for nonverbal cues; when one member is talking, observe how others react to see whether or not they support what she’s saying.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_032">Barton A. Weitz, Stephen Byron Castleberry, and John F. Tanner, <em class="emphasis">Selling: Building Partnerships</em>, 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003), 265.</span> If the energy in the room feels low, or if you get the sense that the group is getting restless, consider moving on to the next part of your presentation or changing tactics.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s01_s02_p05">Sometimes you won’t know who or how many people you will be presenting to beforehand, so you won’t be able to research the individuals. However, it’s always a good idea to ask when you call to schedule your meeting. You may be able to find out information that your contact at the organization wouldn’t otherwise volunteer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_p01">You also might not know <em class="emphasis">where</em> your presentation will happen. If you know you’ll be presenting to your prospect at his office or in a conference room at his company, you won’t have control over the environment. What happens if your prospect has reserved a meeting room and when you arrive there are no empty walls on which you can project the PowerPoint presentation you brought along? When you know you’ll be presenting in an unfamiliar environment, make sure to have a contingency plan in place. If slides or other multimedia equipment are central to your presentation, talk to someone at the company to make sure you’ll be able to use the equipment. And if this fails, be ready to rely on your handouts, product samples, or the good old whiteboard to carry the presentation through.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_p02">Of course, in other situations, you will have control over the environment. In real estate, for instance, the presentation takes place inside the product. In retail, the presentation generally happens at your store. And there are other selling situations in which the prospect will come to your office or a conference room at your company or where you will meet at a “neutral” location like a rented meeting space.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_033">John Chapin, “Sales Presentations—How Location Can Affect Your Presentation and What to Do,” CompleteSelling.com, blog post, March 14, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.completeselling.com/members/completeselling/blog/VIEW/00000009/00000076/Sales-Presentations---How-Location-can-affect-Your-Sales-Presentation-and-What-to-Do.html">http://www.completeselling.com/members/completeselling/blog/VIEW/00000009/00000076/Sales-Presentations---How-Location-can-affect-Your-Sales-Presentation- and-What-to-Do.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Here are a few guidelines to follow, depending on the environment in which you’ll be presenting.</p>

Make sure you set up any presentation materials well in advance and have refreshments set out in the conference room or your office. Think about ways you can add personal touches—for instance, a sign with the prospect’s name on it (“[Your company name] welcomes [prospect’s company name]”), or, for a group presentation, information packets at each person’s seat with his or her name on the front. Sales professional John Chapin suggests having small items on hand that you can give to your prospect, such as pens or calculators with your company logo on them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_034">John Chapin, “Sales Presentations—How Location Can Affect Your Presentation and What to Do,” CompleteSelling.com, blog post, March 14, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.completeselling.com/members/completeselling/blog/VIEW/00000009/00000076/Sales-Presentations---How-Location-can-affect-Your-Sales-Presentation-and-What-to-Do.html">http://www.completeselling.com/members/completeselling/blog/VIEW/00000009/00000076/Sales-Presentations---How-Location-can-affect-Your-Sales-Presentation- and-What-to-Do.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Small, thoughtful details can make an important difference.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p01">If you are giving your presentation in a neutral location like a rented conference room you have the freedom to set up and work out any technical bugs well beforehand. When Keith Waldon of Earth Preserv was preparing for the presentation that secured his biggest customer, JCPenney, he rented a boardroom in a building near JCPenney’s corporate headquarters. He opted for the rented space so that he could pull out all the stops for the presentation. “I wanted to catch JCPenney by surprise,” Waldon says.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p02">When the five executives arrived, Waldon had set up multimedia equipment for video, sound, and slides. He had placed a thick binder of presentation materials (including television storyboards, magazine advertisements, and product comparisons) at each executive’s seat with his name and the JCPenney corporate logo embossed on the front. Besides the conference room, Waldon had also rented an empty storefront in the same building, and halfway through the presentation, he took his customers to see the retail window display he had created there to look like one JCPenney might use to display Earth Preserv products in their stores.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_035">Susan Greco, “Anatomy of a Launch: The Five-Hour Multimedia Sales Presentation,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, October 1, 1995, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19951001/2441.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19951001/2441.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

Bring refreshments, set up any multimedia equipment well in advance, and arrive early to make sure everything is in working order at the facility.

Unless there is a good chance that a prospect will become a key customer, it usually isn’t practical for a salesperson to travel long distances to make one presentation.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s04_p04">Of course, there are some drawbacks to giving sales presentations through video conferencing rather than in person. For one thing, it’s always easier to establish rapport with your prospect if you’re able to have a face-to-face interaction. Video conferences offer the benefit of visuals, so you and your prospect can read one another’s body language and visual cues, but this is not a complete substitute for sitting in the same room with someone. Additionally, since the presentation relies entirely on technology—both on your end and on the prospect’s end—there is a greater chance that a technological malfunction could prevent the presentation from working.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s04_p05">In-person presentations are still the most effective and personal method, so whenever you are able (and when it is practical) to give a face-to-face presentation, this is your best option. However, technology keeps improving, and online meetings and video teleconferences are becoming more successful as an alternative method all the time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_038">“Sales Trends: Electronic Sales Presentations,” KnowThis.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/selling-trends-electronic-sales-presentations">http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/selling-trends-electronic-sales-presentations</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Depending on your selling situation, this is something you might consider. As online sales strategist Joanna Lees Castro points out, video conferencing can be <em class="emphasis">almost</em> as effective as an in-person meeting in a number of selling situations, and it is certainly a better, more personal approach than e-mail or telephone.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_039">Joanna Lees Castro, “Using Video Conferencing to Host an Effective Online Sales Presentation—6 Best Practice Tips,” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?id=1316495">http://ezinearticles.com/?id=1316495</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s04_p06">Even though video conferencing feels different from in-person communications, you should essentially treat your online meetings the way you would treat any sales call. Keep in mind that nonverbal communication has a strong influence on interactions—and, especially with good technology, your customer can see you clearly. Pay attention to your body language and facial expressions, and avoid personal gestures (like playing with your hair or scratching an itch).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_040">“Video Conferencing Etiquette Checklist,” Manage Smarter, June 8, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.presentations.com/msg/content_display/training/e3i0fe06f39ca140432cc75be4595e2c6e1">http://www.presentations.com/msg/content_display/training/e3i0fe06f39ca140432cc75be4595e2c6e1</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Dress professionally, plan your agenda carefully, and make sure to prepare and get your materials set up ahead of time. If you are conferencing from a location other than your office, arrive early to make sure the technology is set up to run smoothly for your presentation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s04_p07">It is also important to resist the temptation to multitask during your video conference. Close down any other applications you might have open on your computer, clear off your desk, and make sure you will not be interrupted until the call is over. Mute any cell phones and close the door to the room in which you are presenting. Give your customer your full attention. While this level of focus is a given on your end, unfortunately, you can’t always be certain that your prospect will give a video conference meeting <em class="emphasis">his</em> full attention by minimizing distractions. For this reason, it is especially important to have a clear agenda that you follow closely. Keep your presentation brief, and be aware that you will have to work harder to hold your prospect’s attention. Live interaction from your audience is critical to make sure your participants are engaged.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s02_s04_p08">Besides a greater likelihood of distraction, there are a few other extra considerations to keep in mind in a video conference situation. <em class="emphasis">Sales and Management</em> magazine notes that privacy is expected during a video conference, so if you want to record part of your presentation, it is important to ask your prospect for permission.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_041">“Video Conferencing Etiquette Checklist,” Manage Smarter, June 8, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.presentations.com/msg/content_display/training/e3i0fe06f39ca140432cc75be4595e2c6e1">http://www.presentations.com/msg/content_display/training/e3i0fe06f39ca140432cc75be4595e2c6e1</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> When the presentation is over, Joanna Lees Castro suggests closing the meeting with a clear call to action in which you include a wrap-up and well-defined next steps that you and your prospects should take. At the end of a conventional sales presentation, Lees Castro points out, next-step discussions can happen more organically, as the customer is walking you to the door, but this is obviously impossible in an online situation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_042">Joanna Lees Castro, “Using Video Conferencing to Host an Effective Online Sales Presentation—6 Best Practice Tips,” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?id=1316495">http://ezinearticles.com/?id=1316495</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_p01">In the best sales presentations, the product or service comes alive. Try to see the presentation through your prospect’s eyes. What is the best way to capture his imagination? How will you tell the story that will make your product or service compelling? In what ways can you delight or surprise your customer? Few people know how to do this better than Dann Ilicic, CEO of Wow Branding. Wow, a small start-up, frequently outperforms big name competitors when vying for a prospect. Ilicic approaches each presentation with the same mind-set: you can’t bore your customer into buying from you, so why not dazzle them? One customer said the presentation Ilicic put together for his company couldn’t have been better: “Dann unquestionably knocked it out of the park compared with the other firms, and they were really high-end firms with spectacular portfolios.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_043">Stephanie Clifford, “Fasten Your Seatbelts,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, February 1, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070201/features-sales-performance-ilicic.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070201/features-sales-performance-ilicic.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_p02">So how does Wow Branding wow its prospects? Ilicic’s approach offers three lessons:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take customization to a new level</strong>. Ilicic says he and his team spend about fifty hours preparing for a sales presentation. They call low-level employees in the customer company, the company’s past customers, and companies that have chosen not to do business with the prospect to learn things the prospects might not even know about themselves. Glumac, an engineering firm in Portland, Oregon, and one of Wow’s customers, said Ilicic’s technique “was a brilliant move…because he wasn’t asking what our imagery should be”; instead, he researched to find out what the image already was.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Never miss an opportunity to delight</strong>. Ilicic likes to surprise his customers with the small things: like stamping green thumbprints throughout a proposal for an agricultural company—or, for a pharmaceutical company, handing out vitamin bottles on which he has replaced the label with a message about Wow. Sometimes he brings in a cake on which he reveals the suggested name for a new company.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Always make the presentation creative and fun</strong>. This technique engages the customer, even when the meeting agenda isn’t exciting itself. It also allows Wow to get around difficult or sensitive parts of the presentation. Rather than talking about Wow’s successes, Ilicic records customer testimonials about his company and plays these for his prospects. On another occasion, rather than potentially putting a prospect on the defensive by telling the company what their image should be, Ilicic told them that Wow had been assigned a branding project for their biggest competitor. He launched a multimedia presentation to show them their competitor’s branding overhaul, and by the end his prospects were asking themselves, “Why didn’t we think of that?” After the presentation, Ilicic revealed that he hadn’t actually made the campaign for the company’s competitor; it was for them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_044">Stephanie Clifford, “Fasten Your Seatbelts,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, February 1, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070201/features-sales-performance-ilicic.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20070201/features-sales-performance-ilicic.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span>

            <h2 class="title editable block">PowerPoint Presentations</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s01_p01">PowerPoint slides provide an easy way to organize your presentation and add helpful visuals. For many salespeople, PowerPoint is one of their go-to presentation tools. It can be an especially helpful tool for salespeople who are starting out and want the security of a clear framework from which to present. An added benefit is that it doesn’t take much technological know-how to put together a clean-looking PowerPoint demonstration.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s01_p02">On the other hand, not all presentation situations lend themselves to PowerPoint (e.g., conference rooms with no wall space on which to project or presentations given in the field), so if you plan to use this tool, make sure that you will be presenting in a space where you can make it work. Additionally, be aware of—and avoid—a number of common mistakes salespeople make when using PowerPoint that can ruin a presentation. As sales coach and author Anne Miller says, “Putting PowerPoint into the hands of some sales reps is like putting matches into the hands of some children.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_045">Anne Miller, “Death by PowerPoint,” Sales and Sales Management Blog, February 22, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://salesandmanagementblog.com/2008/02/22/guest-article-death-by-powerpoint-by-anne-miller">http://salesandmanagementblog.com/2008/02/22/guest-article-death-by-powerpoint-by-anne-miller</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> To maximize PowerPoint as a tool to successfully sell your story, use the tips in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s01_f02">Figure 10.5 "Guidelines for PowerPoint Visuals"</a>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_046">Anne Miller, “Death by PowerPoint,” Sales and Sales Management Blog, February 22, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://salesandmanagementblog.com/2008/02/22/guest-article-death-by-powerpoint-by-anne-miller">http://salesandmanagementblog.com/2008/02/22/guest-article-death-by-powerpoint-by-anne-miller</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s02_p01">It is usually expected that you will have printed material to give your audience during a presentation. In addition to a printed supplement to your PowerPoint presentation (i.e., something that conveys the same information as your slides and on which your audience can take notes), you might decide to bring along brochures with information about your company, products, and services. What are the benefits of brochures? According to sales expert and author Geoffrey James, in some situations you need a brochure to make your firm look serious. However, James lists “I promise to read your brochure” as one of the top ten lies customers tell sales reps. His conclusion: the brochure might gain you credibility, but it probably won’t get read.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_053">Geoffrey James, “Top 10 Lies Customers Tell Sales Reps,” BNET, April 23, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=2323&amp;page=2">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=2323&amp;page=2</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Don’t rely completely on brochures because they won’t be a focal point of your presentation.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s02_p02">Sometimes a brochure can work as a reminder about you and your company after you’ve left, but this is assuming your customer doesn’t throw the brochure away. When it comes to reminders, a better bet is leaving something functional that your customer will actually use regularly. These reminder objects—calendars, refrigerator magnets, pens, or mouse pads labeled with your company name—are called premium leave-behinds and are a proven method of reminding customers you exist.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_054">Brad Sugars, “Building Repeat Business from Day 1,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, May 22, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/startingabusiness/startupbasics/startupbasicscolumnistbradsugars/article178724.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/startingabusiness/startupbasics/startupbasicscolumnistbradsugars/article178724.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Almost all salespeople bring some sort of brochure or premium leave-behind on their sales calls.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s03_p01">There is almost no better way to make your story come to life for your customer than letting him experience it for himself. Think of television courtroom dramas: when the lawyer is making her final statement to the jury and she wants to pull out all the stops, what does she do? She doesn’t just give the jury the facts or tell them the version of the story she wants them to believe—she brings the story to life; she puts the gun in the defendant’s hand; she brings out the pictures of the stab wounds. Think about this when you plan your sales presentation. During the presentation, you can bring your story to life by offering product samples for your prospects to try or by running demonstrations that let them see for themselves what your product can do. When winemakers sell their products to large distributors, they don’t just bring in descriptions of their wines for the buyers to read; they offer tastings so buyers can experience the product. When caterers want to sell their services to someone who is planning a wedding, they bring in samples from their menus, so the customer can say, “Wow this pasta really is delicious!” Or think of Keith Waldon of Earth Preserv who didn’t just tell JCPenney, “We can make displays of our environmentally friendly products for your store windows;” instead, he set up a real shop window display so his prospects could <em class="emphasis">see</em> their place in his story.</p>

When the company first launched in 1998, they knew that 50 percent of board games failed in their first year. Cranium’s strategy? Avoid the traditional board game buyers—toy stores—and sell to someone unexpected. Cranium’s founders managed to get an introduction to Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, and they arrived at his office with a game board and challenged him to a match. After playing a few rounds, Schultz decided this was just the game Starbucks had been looking for—something that would support coffeehouse culture—and Cranium, Inc., had its first major sale.</p>

A salesperson selling insulated windows, for instance, might place a piece of glass in front of a heat lamp and ask her customer to put out his hand and feel the heat. Then the salesperson might substitute the sheet of glass for a window sample. “Now put out your hand,” she will tell the customer. “Can you feel how this window is going to keep the elements out and save you money on your energy bills?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_056">EDTM, Inc., “4 Steps to Close More Sales,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.solarstop.net/edtm/sales_demonstration.htm">http://www.solarstop.net/edtm/sales_demonstration.htm</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span>

Miles, <em class="emphasis">The 30 Second Encyclopedia of Learning and Performance</em> (New York: AMACOM, 2003), 139–40.</span> Imagine you are selling an energy-efficient commercial dishwasher to a pizza kitchen. The dishwasher costs $3,000, but average cost savings per year are $800 in energy bills and $200 in water usage: a total of $1,000.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_060">Energy Star, “Commercial Dishwashers for Consumers,” U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Energy, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=comm_dishwashers.pr_comm_dishwashers">http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=comm_dishwashers.pr_comm_dishwashers</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Your dishwashers are guaranteed to last a long time; in fact, you offer a five-year warranty on any purchase. At a savings rate of $1,000 each year, your customer will have saved $5,000 in energy and water expenses by the time his warranty expires. Based on this information, you present this cost-benefit analysis to your prospect:</p>
            <span class="informalequation block">$3,000 = cost (initial investment)</span>
            <span class="informalequation block">cost savings – initial investment = benefit</span>
            <span class="informalequation block">$5,000 – $3,000 = $2,000</span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s04_p03">In this case, the cost savings is $1,000 per year times five years for a total of $5,000, minus the initial investment of $3,000, means that there is a benefit of $2,000.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s04_p04">In other words, the dishwasher has a three-to-two cost-benefit ratio over five years ($3,000 in cost to $2,000 in benefit). You can tell him, “This purchase will save you money in the long run. After you make back what you spent on the dishwasher in cost savings, you will continue to save $1,000 each year.” Similarly, you can show your customer a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">return on investment (ROI) analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Shows the return (profit or cost savings) as a percentage of the initial investment.</span></span>. ROI shows the customer the return (profit or cost savings) compared to the investment he will make. In the case of the dishwasher, the ROI would be calculated by dividing the benefit (in this case $2,000) by the cost of the product or initial investment (in this case $3,000), then multiplying the result by 100, which would yield a 66 percent ROI after five years.</p>
            <span class="informalequation block">$2000 (savings over five years)  ÷ $3,000 (initial investment) × 100 = 66% ROI</span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s03_s03_s04_p05">You can maximize ROI by cutting costs, increasing profits, or accelerating the rate at which profits are made.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_061">“Cost of Ownership, ROI, and Cost/Benefit Analysis: What’s the Difference?” Solution Matrix, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.solutionmatrix.com/tco-roi-cba-difference.html">http://www.solutionmatrix.com/tco-roi-cba-difference.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Some businesses have a minimum ROI that must be met before a purchase can be approved. While you might be able to learn this information in your preapproach, it is more likely that you will have to discuss minimum ROI with your customer during the sales presentation. You might present your solution and find out more about your customer’s specific needs (including budget constraints and minimum ROI) during the first sales presentation and then write up a proposal in response to your findings, which you deliver during a second presentation.</p>

When conducting a group presentation, take group dynamics into account, keeping in mind that people act differently in group situations than they do in one-on-one interactions.</li>
                    <li>When you are delivering your presentation at your place of business or in a neutral location (like a rented space), treat the customer as you would treat a guest in your home. Set up refreshments and supplies well ahead of time so that you are well prepared when the prospect arrives.</li>
                    <li>When you are presenting at your prospect’s place of business, try to find out about the presentation venue beforehand—but be prepared to adapt if your prospect doesn’t have the equipment or setup you were expecting. Arrive early so that you have time to set up.</li>
                    <li>If your presentation is given as a Webinar or video conference, treat the presentation as you would treat an in-person interaction. Dress professionally and set up ahead of time. Make sure to minimize distractions.</li>
                    <li>When delivering a PowerPoint presentation, keep your slides brief, uncluttered, and easy to read. Don’t let the technology overshadow you, the presenter.</li>
                    <li>There is almost no better way to bring your product to life than by using samples or demonstrations to get your prospect involved.</li>
                    <li>Your customer will expect you to bring a <strong class="emphasis bold">cost-benefit analysis</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">ROI analysis</strong> as a way to quantify your solution.</li>

                    <li>You are giving a presentation to a busy manager who initially tells you that she can only give you thirty minutes of her time. She seems brisk and businesslike at first, but when you are in her office, you notice a picture of her son in a soccer uniform and mention that your kids are involved in soccer. After this, she relaxes and begins discussing her children at length. Keeping in mind that (a) you have an agenda to get through but (b) establishing a connection is important to you, and you want to take your cue from your prospect, how do you respond, and why?</li>
                    <li>You are giving a presentation to a group and notice that one member of the group is more vocal than others and tends to dominate the conversation. What are some strategies you could use to make sure that other members of the group have a chance to participate and contribute their opinions?</li>
                    <li>Choose a product or service and prepare a short sales presentation that includes a demonstration. What other items do you need besides the product or service to perform the demonstration (e.g., Internet service for software; water for instant coffee; plates, silverware, and napkins for food products)? How is the product demonstration integrated into your presentation? How do you use the demonstration to engage the prospect with the product or service?</li>
                    <li>Assume you are selling environmental design consulting, and an important part of your sales presentation involves using your company Web site to demonstrate previous projects you have completed, interactive customer surveys, and your company’s brand image. However, when you arrive at your customer’s place of business to set up your presentation, you learn that the Internet has been down all morning and may not be back up until the next day. What could you have done to prepare for this sort of unforeseen problem in advance?</li>
                    <li>Find a PowerPoint presentation you have created for another class—or if this is unavailable, find a PowerPoint presentation online; Slideshare is a good resource: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net">http://www.slideshare.net</a>. Offer a critique of the presentation based on the information you learned in this chapter.</li>
                    <li>Assume you are a sales rep for an Internet advertising company. Your prospect, an online hardware retailer that specializes in compression pumps, is concerned about making the investment for Internet advertising. You want to incorporate the ROI into your presentation. If the prospect spends $90,000 in advertising, it will generate 120,000 clicks to the company Web site. At a 2 percent conversion rate (2 percent of the customers who visit the site make a purchase), that is 2,400 orders. If each order is $230, the sales generated from the online ad would be $552,000. What is the prospect’s ROI (show your math)? How would you incorporate this ROI into your sales presentation?</li>
                    <li>Imagine that you are selling high-end electronic equipment. Your prospect has agreed to purchase a laptop for $800. Now you tell him about the benefits of purchasing the service agreement, which includes free battery replacement and computer cleaning every year for three years for only $120. A replacement battery costs $200, and a computer cleaning costs $85. How much will the customer save if he purchases the service agreement assuming he needs to replace the battery and have the laptop cleaned once a year? How would you incorporate this into your sales presentation?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_p01">In 1988, Neil Rackham and his company Huthwaite, Inc., researched more than 35,000 sales calls, observing successful and experienced sales professionals doing what they do best. In the process they disproved a number of popular myths about the selling process, and they developed a sales model of their own, which they called SPIN selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_062">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">The SPIN Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 8; Greg Woodley, “SPIN Selling Is Good,” SellingandPersuasionTechniques.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingandpersuasiontechniques.com/SPIN-selling.html">http://www.sellingandpersuasiontechniques.com/SPIN-selling.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Today sales professionals around the world incorporate the SPIN selling model into their sales process with great success—and if you learn a few simple principles, you can too. The following section describes SPIN selling in a nutshell.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is SPIN Selling?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SPIN</a><span class="glossdef">A customer centered sales model. SPIN stands for the four kinds of questions successful salespeople ask their customers: <strong class="emphasis bold">S</strong>ituation, <strong class="emphasis bold">P</strong>roblem, <strong class="emphasis bold">I</strong>mplication, and <strong class="emphasis bold">N</strong>eed-payoff.</span></span> works from the theory that relationship selling is customer-centric. It requires you to adapt your selling process to your customer, and it delivers personal solutions. To make this work, you have to ask your buyer a lot of questions, let him do most of the talking, and give his responses your full attention.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_p02">In the SPIN model, there are four components of a sales call: opening, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment. SPIN gets its name from the four kinds of questions that take place during the investigation stage: <strong class="emphasis bold">S</strong>ituation, <strong class="emphasis bold">P</strong>roblem, <strong class="emphasis bold">I</strong>mplication, and <strong class="emphasis bold">N</strong>eed-payoff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_p03">With smaller sales, these four components of the sale (opening, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment) often happen sequentially and in a short period of time; a customer might walk onto your car lot and commit to buying a car from you an hour later. But often in business-to-business (B2B) sales, especially complex ones, you will incorporate SPIN components into a number of the steps in your selling process. For instance, you will do some investigation during your preapproach, and you might make an early presentation in which you open, investigate, and demonstrate capability. Because larger sales take more time, you won’t close the sale at the end of your first presentation, but you might get a commitment from your customer to move the sale forward. SPIN selling is not a rigid, step-by-step model; rather it provides an effective, flexible framework for customer centered selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_063">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">SPIN Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 38.</span></p>

SPIN selling is all about customization; when you are demonstrating capability, you want to show your prospect how your solution applies to the needs he has expressed. Listing a product’s advantages demonstrates how that product could be useful to anyone (a generic customer), but you don’t want to treat your buyer like a generic customer.

It might take several years before your prospect agrees to purchase your solution, so a sales call that ends without a sale is in no way a failure.

To deliver customized value to your prospect, you have to understand his needs and make sure that you are in agreement with him about a solution he could use. This means the sales presentation is a two-way communication. When you make the effort to listen to your prospect this way and when you work to understand his needs, not only will you close more sales, but you will also build stronger, lasting customer relationships. Your prospect will come to trust you and to rely on you as a problem-solving expert.</p>

Many restaurant companies opt to leave the training up to the individual restaurants, which leads to inconsistency and lack of implementation. Companies may not realize how risky this is; the fine for improper implementation is $10,000 per restaurant.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_p04">While there is no one magic formula that will make your presentation come to life, successful presentations generally have a number of elements in common. Thinking of your presentation in terms of the following five steps will help you to plan and execute it with greater ease and success. Before the presentation, it’s a good idea to ask your prospect how much time is allotted for your presentation. That will help you tailor your presentation appropriately, keeping in mind your prospect’s time. It’s also a good idea to start the meeting by setting expectations in terms of time: “Just as a time check, I’ll spend thirty minutes on the presentation and allow fifteen minutes for discussion. We’ll plan to wrap up by 11 o’clock.”</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Build Rapport</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p01">In relationship selling, building rapport with your prospect lays the foundation for a selling partnership that could continue for many years. Especially if the sales presentation will be your first in-person interaction with your prospect, put effort into making a good impression. Offer your prospect a firm handshake and start with some small talk to break the ice. This isn’t difficult; you can establish a connection with a complete stranger over something as simple as the weather or a recent sporting event. Experienced salespeople use observation to their advantage, learning about the customer by noticing the environment of the prospect’s office. Are their photographs or artwork displayed on the walls? What items does the customer keep on her desk? As Bruce Harris, account manager with UPS, says, “A person’s office is a reflection of who they are and serves as an insight into his/her personality.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_080">Bruce Harris, “The Eyes Have It,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em> 54, no. 3 (2009): 17</span> You can make a personal connection and break the ice by questioning your prospect about a family photograph or a trophy he keeps on display. However, make sure not to go overboard on the small talk. Remember that your prospect is busy and has a limited amount of time to meet with you. If you spend too long on chit chat, you will eat up some of the time you need to get through your call objectives. Build rapport and then get down to business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_081">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">SPIN Selling</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 144.</span> This is also a perfect time to confirm the time that is allocated to you for your presentation. Although you discussed it when you set up the appointment, it’s always a good idea to confirm since things change at the last minute. This will help you quickly make adjustments if need be.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p02">In group presentations, it is harder to leave room for small talk because if everyone starts talking, the meeting could lose its focus quickly—and in very large sales presentations, small talk is impossible. Geoffrey James suggests building “group rapport” by opening your presentation with a memorable remark: something challenging or amusing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_082">Geoffrey James, “How to Give a Killer Sales Presentation,” BNET, May 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=2940">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=2940</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> You could also open with a brief anecdote that establishes a common connection: “When I dropped my son off at school this morning, he told me to make sure not to give a boring presentation today.…” A comment like this might get a chuckle out of your audience and will build a connection because others in the audience probably have children as well and may have had common experiences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p03">Leading your presentation off with situation questions is another way to break the ice and get people talking. In group settings, people are often uncomfortable sharing their opinions right away, but if you ask questions that call for factual observation, rather than opinion (How many departments in your organization would be affected by this decision?

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p01">Keep in mind that to effectively demonstrate capability, you should sell benefits—solutions that address your prospect’s specific needs—rather than features or advantages. If your sales call is a follow-up on a previous call, you can make a benefit statement early on that will address issues you discussed in your last meeting:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p02">In our previous discussion, you mentioned that you had a minimum ROI requirement of 20 percent per year, and you said that you would be interested in pursuing this sale further if we could propose a solution that would meet your requirements. I’ve created an ROI analysis here that shows how outsourcing your back office work through our firm will yield an annual ROI of 25 percent. Other businesses like yours have experienced these results with us and have been very satisfied with the transition. Here’s what we envision for your company. (Show a slide with a diagram or chart giving a visual representation of your prospect’s cost savings with this solution.) Is this something you would be interested in?</p>

If you are interested in learning more and engaging your customer in your presentation, be ready with open-ended questions. For example, the situation, problem, implication, and need-payback questions in SPIN selling are all examples of open-ended questions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p01">Once you have investigated to uncover your prospect’s needs, deliver a specific benefit statement: one that demonstrates in detail how you are going to solve his unique problem. It’s impossible to deliver a specific benefit statement at the opening of your sales call because there is no way you can understand your prospect’s needs and expectations without listening to him first.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_084">Michael T. Bosworth, <em class="emphasis">Solution Selling: Creating Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995), 101.</span> Sometimes, a prospect may ask you to solve a problem that sounds similar to one you just solved for another company or customer, but if you assume you already understand your prospect’s situation and treat her just like your old customer, you might lose the sale. Approach each new presentation as if it were your first.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p02">In B2B sales, the specific benefit statement is generally something you prepare before your presentation (recall the discussion of this from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch08#fwk-125752-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Preapproach: The Power of Preparation"</a>). However, before launching into specific benefits, you can investigate to make sure you understand and have all the necessary information: “So let me make sure I understand. What you’re saying is that a 5 percent reduction in process time will reduce your costs by 20 percent?” In any selling situation, the information you get from your prospect is usually just the tip of the iceberg, and you won’t get an idea of the pressures she is facing unless you can get her talking.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p03">After confirming that you and your prospect are on the same page, you can move forward with your presentation, adapting if you need to based on your prospect’s answers to the questions you asked. This is the part of your presentation where the solution really comes to life. Bring your customer into the story with videos, recordings, displays, or anything else that will allow him to experience the product for himself.</p>

In the example above, when your prospect takes the car out on the road, you could turn on the climate control settings that allow her to adjust for a different climate zone in the front and back seats and explain that this way she and her family can stay comfortable on long car rides. If she has her kids along, you could turn on the rear DVD player for them. These sort of extra, customer-specific benefits help your customer to make a personal connection to the product and to see her story aligning with your solution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p10">During this part of the presentation, make sure to ask open-ended questions that will help you learn more about the prospect’s needs and her perceptions about the product: “You said that you like to go on family camping trips; how well does your current vehicle meet your family’s needs on these trips? It sounds like your current vehicle gets poor gas mileage; how does this affect your frequency of use or the length of your road trips? How would the storage capacity of the RAV4 change the way you use your family vehicle? How important is the car’s sound system to you?” Not only will these questions help you to uncover your customer’s needs and expectations that are still below the surface, but they will also help you to anticipate potential objections as you transition to the next part of the selling process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s04_p01">This is the reason you are here—to present your solution that will solve your prospect’s problem. Since you started your presentation by asking questions, your presentation is a perfect way to incorporate the things you just learned from your prospect and incorporate them into your presentation. Yes, this means you have to be quick on your feet. That’s another reason preparation is so important.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your presentation pithy</strong>. A shorter presentation is better. It helps you get to the point more quickly and have more time for dialogue with your prospect.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_086">Kelley Robertson, “How to Create a Powerful Sales Presentation,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Start with a quick review of the prospect’s objectives</strong>. This is a good technique to confirm that you were listening to your prospect throughout the process so far and confirms that you are on the same page. This also provides the ideal platform on which to present your solution and why it will help your prospect reach his objectives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_087">Kevin Davis, “10 Tips for Winning Sales Presentations,” Business Know-How, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm">http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get a reaction from your prospect throughout your presentation</strong>. Use a combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions to confirm that your prospect is in agreement with the information you are presenting and to gain new insights into how your product or service can help him. “This time savings in your production cycle can help you save at least 10 percent over your current processing. Would you like to see how this would work?” is an example of a closed-ended question that helps keep your prospect engaged. “How do you think your team would like to submit invoices like this?” is an example of an open-ended question that helps the prospect think about the product or service in use in his organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_088">Kevin Davis, “10 Tips for Winning Sales Presentations,” Business Know-How, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm">http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use demonstrations whenever possible</strong>. Showing how a product or service will work is far more dramatic and memorable than simply talking about it. If it’s possible to demonstrate the product in person, do it. If not, have a demonstration video. Bring samples, mock-ups, or prototypes if the actual product is not yet available.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_089">Kelley Robertson, “How to Create a Powerful Sales Presentation,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have fun</strong>. When your passion and enthusiasm come through, it makes a difference to your prospect. A monotone or boring presentation is neither interesting nor compelling. Show your prospect you believe in your product or service with a powerful and personal presentation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_090">Kelley Robertson, “How to Create a Powerful Sales Presentation,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>

How likely is he to make a commitment now?

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s02_p01">Have you ever noticed that when you go into a high-end clothing boutique or a store that sells expensive jewelry and watches, the price tags are hidden? The thing you immediately see is the product itself, beautifully displayed. The goal is a psychological one: to get the buyer to make an emotional connection with the product before he considers the cost. As a buyer, if the cost were one of the first things you saw, you might never make that emotional connection with the product in the first place.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s02_p02">This is something to keep in mind in sales. Never present a proposal—or otherwise mention pricing—early on in the sales presentation, not until your prospect has fallen in love with your product. You want your prospect to pick out the color of the car before she asks about payment; if she picks out the color, she has already imagined herself owning the car, and you have probably made your sale.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s02_p03">Of course, in a situation like car sales, you generally present the proposal in the same day as you present the product. You discuss your prospect’s needs, show him the car, let him test drive it, and then tell him, “Let me go talk to my manager to see if we can work out the numbers.” The process is a relatively simple one. However, in complex B2B sales, your sales presentation will probably <em class="emphasis">end</em> with a request for a proposal, in which case you will agree to a future meeting when you can present your proposal to the customer. B2B proposals are generally more involved, and so they require careful planning and a greater investment of time. If your prospect says, “Just send us the proposal,” ask for a face-to-face meeting; you can always send them the proposal ahead of time, but following up with a meeting in-person will help you address objections, answer your prospect’s questions, and demonstrate your enthusiasm for the project.</p>

As one homeowner put it, “As a seller, you want your house presented and marketed well.” According to her customers, Stephens has mastered the art of bringing the product to life: “The videos and photographs [she] produced of the properties we sold were so nice it almost made us want to buy them back from ourselves!” Another customer praised Smith’s customization, explaining that she considered “the applicability of the real estate transaction to our personal situation and objectives.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_103">“Testimonials,” Chico Real Estate, Inc., <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.chicorealestate.net/Testimonials.aspx">http://www.chicorealestate.net/Testimonials.aspx</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Delivering Value in Your Proposal</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s03_p01">Until you understand the areas in which your customer places the greatest value, it is impossible to come up with a proposal. For instance, say your organization offers advertising services, and you find out from your prospect that her company especially values competitive pricing on individual projects. You decide the best way to deliver value is to drop your pricing below the competitor’s lowest price and to make up for the lower cost in your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">retainer fee</a><span class="glossdef">Fixed fee that a customer will pay in advance to secure your services.</span></span>—the fixed fee that your customer will pay in advance to secure your services. This way you can deliver value in the area that is most important to your customer while still generating the profits you need to run your business. In the end, you want a situation where everyone wins—but it takes some work to uncover the key to making this happen.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s03_p02">Sometimes your customer’s area of greatest value is determined by business needs, and other times the issues are emotional. For instance, if you are selling a car to a customer that wants a good value on his trade-in, recognize that he might have an emotional connection to his old car (in his mind it has a high value), so offering a low trade-in price, even if it is combined with competitive financing options, might be enough to drive your customer away. In fact, your customer might actually be willing to pay <em class="emphasis">more</em> for his new car if you can give him a good price for his trade-in.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Closed-ended questions</strong> help keep the prospect engaged and should be balanced with <strong class="emphasis bold">open-ended questions</strong>, which help you probe further into the problem your product can solve.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s01_p01">In a sales presentation, you want to make your product come to life by showcasing it in a way that gets your audience involved. You want your prospect to “smell the leather in the car.” The same is true at a job interview; it’s not just about your résumé. Let your interviewer see examples of the work you’ve done and help her to envision the work you can do for her company. You can start preparing for this now, while you’re still a student. Bring your portfolio on every interview. If you need some tips, review the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch06#fwk-125752-ch06">Chapter 6 "Why and How People Buy: The Power of Understanding the Customer"</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Accept and Confirm the Interview</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s02_p01">When one of your target companies calls or e-mails to offer you an interview, don’t leave anything to chance. Grab a pencil and paper or your personal digital assistant (PDA) and take down the information you’ll need to know on the day of the interview. Do you have the correct day and time written down? Do you know the name, title, and office location of the person with whom you’ll be interviewing? Do you have directions to the company’s location? Keep in mind that googling the company’s address on the day of your interview may not get you where you want to go. Sometimes companies have large campuses with a number of buildings, and Google won’t be able to tell you how to find the right entrance to the right building and how to find your contact person’s office once you get there. Take care of logistical details like this beforehand, so you won’t have anything to slow you down on the big day.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s02_p02">While you have a contact from the company on the phone, take the opportunity to ask whether there is a job description on the company Web site that you can review before the interview. It’s also a good idea to ask for the title of the job for which you will be interviewing and the names and titles of the people with whom you will be interviewing. You should also ask for your interviewer’s phone number and e-mail, and bring the phone number with you on the day of the interview in case you are unavoidably delayed. E-mail your interviewer several days in advance of the interview to confirm your appointment, or call her the day before. This demonstrates professionalism and ensures that everything will run smoothly.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_104">Kim Richmond, “10 Tips for Successful Interviews,” presentation in the How to Market Yourself as a Brand to Get the Job You Want Workshop Series, Upper Merion Township Library, King of Prussia, PA, June 1, 2009.</span></p>

Begin by reviewing the job description on the company Web site if it’s available. Then spend some time on the Web site, researching the company’s mission statement and description. If you know which department you might be working in, pay careful attention to any specific details you can learn about this department on the Web site. Some of the basic facts employers will expect you to know include</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s03_p02">Then go beyond Web site research; after all, your interviewer knows what’s on his company’s Web site, so don’t just repeat back the information you find there; show him your motivation and professionalism by coming prepared with your own research. Use the company’s product or service and talk to other people who use the product or service. Go online and read what customers have to say about the company. Go through the company’s purchasing process so you can understand the workings of the company from a customer’s point of view.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_106">Kim Richmond, “10 Tips for Successful Interviews,” presentation in the How to Market Yourself as a Brand to Get the Job You Want Workshop Series, Upper Merion Township Library, King of Prussia, PA, June 1, 2009.</span> Read any recent press releases or press coverage about the company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s03_p03">Don’t forget to research your interviewer. Chances are, he has a profile on LinkedIn so you can get some insight about him and even see what he looks like. Also do a Google search as you may learn about his personal hobbies and other pertinent information.</p>

While there’s no way to know which questions you’ll get for sure, you can be relatively certain that your interviewer will ask at least one or two of the common standbys. Preparing answers to popular interview questions beforehand will empower to respond with clarity and poise. “What traps a lot of people is they think and talk at the same time,” says Bill McGowan, founder of Clarity Media Group. “It’s better if you know your conversational path.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_108">Sarah E.

            <h3 class="title">Common Interview Questions</h3>
            <p class="simpara">What Are Some of Your Greatest Strengths?</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s05_p03">Most candidates will respond to this question in generalities like “I’m a strong self-starter” or “I’m highly organized.” You already have your personal brand positioning points and stories to go with them, so why not use them here? You will set yourself apart if you can illustrate your strengths with the anecdotes you have prepared ahead of time. For example, “My leadership skills are among my greatest strengths. As the shift leader at Olive Garden, I scheduled the wait staff and resolved customer service issues during my shift. The restaurant had the highest customer satisfaction ratings during the two years I worked there.”</p>
            <p class="simpara">What Are Some of Your Weaknesses?</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s05_p04">The interviewer isn’t looking for any deep confessions when she asks you this question. According to CareerBuilder.com, “The secret to answering this question is using your weaknesses to your advantage.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_109">CareerBuilder.com, “Answering 6 Common Interview Questions,” <em class="emphasis">CNN.com</em>, December 9, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/12/09/six.questions/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/Careers/12/09/six.questions/index.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> For instance, if you say that you have trouble with organization, you can follow this up by saying that because organization doesn’t come naturally to you, you make a conscious effort at the beginning of a new project to plan out your goals. It’s never a good idea to simply name a weakness and finish off by telling the interviewer it’s something you are working on. On the other hand, it’s also important to be honest when you respond to the weakness question; don’t try to pretend that you are without faults because that won’t make you look good either.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s06_p01">Toward the end of the interview, every interviewer will ask you if you have any questions for him. So make sure you have three or four questions in mind. Preparing these ahead of time will show your interviewer that you have thought about the position and the company. Here are a few questions to consider asking:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s06_l01">
            <li>What opportunities will there be beyond this position in the company?</li>
            <li>What would the ideal person for this position look like?</li>
            <li>What are some challenges facing the department in the next three months? What role will the person in this position play in tackling these challenges?</li>
            <li>How would you describe your company culture?</li>
            <li>What are the next steps in the hiring process?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s06_p02">After the interviewer responds, be ready to follow up by restating your strengths.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_116">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em> 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 186.</span> For instance, if you ask what qualities the ideal candidate for this job should have, your interviewer might mention something you hadn’t thought of mentioning earlier. You can respond by telling a relevant story about a specific time when you overcame an obstacle or helped a colleague solve a problem.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s06_p03">You can ask these questions even if you already know the answer. If you interview with multiple people in the organization, it is OK to ask the same question multiple times.

            <p class="simpara">When Do I Ask about Salary?</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s06_p04">Finally, even if you have questions about salary and benefits, <em class="emphasis">don’t</em> ask them now. Always delay a conversation about salary as long as possible. In a sales presentation, you wouldn’t pull out a pricing schedule before your customer had expressed a strong interest in buying the product; keep the same idea in mind going into a job interview. It’s best to let your interviewer bring up salary—and that might not be until after the second or third interview. Be patient; the longer your prospective employer has to get to know you, the more opportunities you have to point out why you would be a good addition to the company. If you sell yourself well throughout the interview process, you might even receive a higher offer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s07_p01">Before you interview, take care of the logistics just as you would for any sales presentation. Control the things that are in your power to control so that you can focus on your performance during the interview. Double check that you know where you’ll be going (including building, room, and/or suite number) and allow extra time for travel in case you get stuck in traffic. Make sure you know the title of the position for which you will be interviewing. Remember to assemble your materials the night before the interview: have your work samples ready to go in a portfolio and print at least four extra copies of your résumé on twenty-four-pound paper. Bring these extra résumés in your portfolio. Even though your interviewer will have already received your résumé, she may not have it on hand, and you should always be prepared in case you are asked to meet with anyone who was not on the original interview schedule.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_117">Kim Richmond, “10 Tips for Successful Interviews,” presentation in the How to Market Yourself as a Brand to Get the Job You Want Workshop Series, Upper Merion Township Library, King of Prussia, PA, June 1, 2009.</span> Arrive early, fix any wardrobe malfunctions, and get ready to give a stellar presentation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 8: Prepare Your Wardrobe</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s08_p01">Your wardrobe is part of your personal branding, so make sure you dress like a professional when you go to your interview. This holds true even if you are interviewing in a more casual industry; you can always dress down <em class="emphasis">after</em> you get the job.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s08_l01">
            <li>Dress conservatively. Go for a suit or dress in dark or neutral colors (black, gray, or navy for the suit). Avoid hypertrendy clothes or clothes that otherwise make a bold statement. Women should avoid dresses with thin straps or low necklines.</li>
            <li>Make sure your suit or dress fits you well. If it needs to be tailored, have it done. You will use the suit in your new job, and a good fit will increase your confidence during the interview.</li>
            <li>Wear appropriate, professional shoes. Both men and women should wear conservative, close-toed shoes in a dark or neutral color to complement their wardrobe. Women should avoid stiletto, open-toe, or platform shoes. Men should avoid athletic shoes and make sure their shoes are polished.</li>
            <li>Wear appropriate accessories. Avoid flashy jewelry or watches. Carry a professional briefcase or handbag—<strong class="emphasis bold">no backpacks or messenger bags</strong>. Keep in mind that even your accessories are part of your personal brand.</li>
            <li>If you have tattoos or body piercings, make sure they are not visible during the interview. Make-up such as Conceal FX available at Sephora.com will camouflage tattoos. It is acceptable for women to wear conservative earrings—but avoid anything large or distracting.</li>
            <li>Select appropriate hosiery. If you are wearing a suit, your socks should match your pants or shoes. Women wearing skirts and dresses should always wear pantyhose (even if you think you have a great tan).</li>
            <li>Make sure your clothes are ironed. Do this the night before.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_118">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 197.</span> Lay our your clothes the night before so that you will have one less thing to worry about on the day of the interview. Wrinkled clothing and stains are considered among the biggest grooming red flags for job interviews, according to a recent survey of employers conducted by Gillette Career Advantage.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_119">“USA Today Snapshots,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, Money, December 30, 2009, 1B.</span>
</li>
            <li>Ensure impeccable grooming, including a conservative hairstyle and appropriately manicured fingernails. Don’t forget deodorant and a breath mint; body odor or bad breath can be a turn off in an interview. It’s a good idea to stop in the restroom right before you go to the interview for one last check in the mirror (it’s the perfect time to have a breath mint).</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s09_p01">Make an effort to connect personally with your interviewer. People want to hire people they like. Smile, make eye contact, and greet him with a strong handshake. Allow yourself to relax and begin the conversation with some small talk. Notice the surroundings in your interviewer’s office. Does he have school memorabilia, family photographs, sports paraphernalia, or vacation photos? Try to discover commonalities that will allow you to make a connection. During the interview, remember to smile and maintain eye contact, and when the interview is wrapping up, make sure to close by telling the interviewer you want the job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_120">Kim Richmond, “10 Tips for Successful Interviews,” presentation in the How to Market Yourself as a Brand to Get the Job You Want Workshop Series, Upper Merion Township Library, King of Prussia, PA, June 1, 2009.</span> Most of all, relax, enjoy the conversation, and be yourself.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 10: Follow-Up, Follow-Up, Follow-Up</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s10_p01">Don’t wait to do this! Get in contact while you are still fresh in your interviewer’s mind: write a thank-you e-mail the same day. Details on how to write a successful follow-up e-mail are covered in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch11#fwk-125752-ch11">Chapter 11 "Handling Objections: The Power of Learning from Opportunities"</a>. Besides the e-mail, send a hand-written thank-you note on a plain, white business note card. Mail this the same day, so that your interviewer will receive it the next day or the day after. Very few people send handwritten “thank-you’s” anymore, so this extra touch will make you stand out—and it only costs the price of postage, so why not do it?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s06_s10_p02">During your interview you should ask the interviewer for a time frame so that you will know when to expect a response. If you haven’t heard back by the appointed date, follow up with a phone call. Asking your interviewer for a time frame is essential to follow-up: if she isn’t planning to make her hiring decision for another two weeks, calling her after one week will only be an annoyance. Be persistent, but keep in mind that there is a fine line between persistence and pestering. When you get voice mail, you can leave a message—once—but then keep calling back until you reach your contact. Following up by phone signals that you are still interested in the job and motivated enough to pursue it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_121">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 188.</span> Sometimes hiring decisions get delayed because of issues that come up at the company, so not hearing back by the date you were expecting is not necessarily an indication that you weren’t selected for the position.</p>

                <li>A job interview is like a sales presentation; a successful interview requires a lot of preparation.</li>
                <li>Always be ready for a job interview with a professional portfolio and interview suit including shoes and other accessories.</li>
                <li>When you receive a call for an interview, take the time to write down the date, time, location, title of the position for which you will be interviewing, and the people (names and titles) with whom you will be interviewing.</li>
                <li>Do your homework and thoroughly research the company, its products or services, customers, and competition. The company’s Web site is a good place to start, but if possible also use the product or service or call the company’s 800 number as though you were a prospective customer.</li>
                <li>Prepare for the most likely questions you will be asked including “tell me about yourself.” Review your brand positioning points and stories you want to tell in response to the most commonly asked interview questions.</li>
                <li>Be prepared with questions to ask during the interview.</li>
                <li>Delay the conversation about salary as long as possible; avoid the temptation to bring it up during an interview. It’s best to let the interviewer bring up the topic when she is closer to a final decision.</li>
                <li>Smile and be yourself during the interview. The best way to sell yourself is to be yourself.</li>
                <li>Follow up after the interview with a thank-you note.</li>
