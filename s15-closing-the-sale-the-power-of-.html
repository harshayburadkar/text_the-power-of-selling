    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p02">It’s this line from the classic 1996 movie <em class="emphasis">Jerry Maguire</em> that says it all about negotiating and closing the deal. In the movie, Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who has second thoughts about the way business is conducted, and when he voices his concerns, he loses his job and all his clients except one. Maguire’s passionate plea to his sole client, NFL player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), has become a dramatic metaphor for negotiations and deal making ever since.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_001">Jean-Marc Rocher, “Plot Summary for Jerry Maguire,” IMDb, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/plotsummary">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/plotsummary</a> (accessed November 19, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p03">While the movie is fictional, Maguire’s character was based on real-life sports agent Leigh Steinberg, whose firm has negotiated and closed more than one hundred multimillion-dollar deals for high-profile clients in every professional sport. Steinberg’s philosophy on negotiations and closing deals is based on the fact that life is filled with negotiations and deals—from deciding where to eat to buying houses and cars—and each should be handled with “a clear focus and principled philosophy.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_002">Alan M. Webber, “How to Get Them to Show You the Money,” December 18, 2007, <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/showmoney.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/showmoney.html</a> (accessed November 19, 2009).</span> There’s nothing better than closing a big deal…the right way.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p04">Whether it’s a major professional sports deal, business deal, or a major purchase, it’s easy to visualize what the “desired state” is in any kind of deal. You can actually see the athlete in your team’s uniform, imagine two companies merging together as one, or see yourself in the car you want to buy. In fact, you negotiate every day. You negotiate with everyone from your roommate about how to arrange the furniture to your siblings about who will use the car. You might even negotiate with your professor about when you can hand in an assignment that is late.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p05">The step in the selling process that moves the conversation to a sale (or the desired resolution) is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">close</a><span class="glossdef">Consummation of the sale when the prospect agrees to the purchase.</span></span>. Many people believe that the close takes place at the end of the selling process because that’s when the prospect agrees to buy the product or service. But nothing could be farther from the truth. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Closing</a><span class="glossdef">Bringing the sale to fruition or getting the sale.</span></span> the sale, or getting the order, starts at the beginning of the selling process, long before you even come in contact with the prospect.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s01_p01">“What it takes to win a championship is to have your preparation meet the opportunities, whether it’s out on the racetrack or behind the scenes,” according to NASCAR driver Kurt Busch.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_003">Joe Guertin, “When Did ‘Closing’ Become a Bad Word?” Agency Sales, March 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html">http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> This is true in sports and in selling. Winning in selling—delivering value to customers and to your company—requires good solid preparation and hard work. Sure, there are some sales that fall into your lap. Those are the ones that make it feel like selling is easy. But most sales don’t happen that way. In fact, in many industries closing the sale may take weeks, months, or even years.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Despite the term “close,” which implies the end, closing the sale starts with the first step in the selling process—qualifying. Sometimes salespeople want to fill their sales funnel (or pipeline) with lots of leads so they don’t take the time or ask the right questions when they are qualifying. While it’s true that you want to “go out and get as many <em class="emphasis">no</em>s as you can,” you’ll get a lot more <em class="emphasis">yes</em>es when you pitch to the right prospects.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_004">Joe Guertin, “When Did ‘Closing’ Become a Bad Word?” Agency Sales, March 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html">http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> In fact, the selling process is analogous to building a house; if the foundation is poured right, everything else will easily come together. The same is true in selling—prospecting is the foundation of the entire process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_005">Tim Connor, “The Myth of Closing Sales,” Roderick Martin, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://roderickmartin.com/the-myth-of-closing-sales">http://roderickmartin.com/the-myth-of-closing-sales</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s01_p03">Not only does closing start at the first point in the selling process, but it also is far from the end of the selling process. In fact, closing is a lot like graduation—it is actually the beginning, not the end. Just like graduation is not the end of your education but rather the beginning or commencement of the rest of your life, the closing in sales is the beginning of the relationship with the customer, not the end of the selling process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Closing Time</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p01">The close sounds like it might be a definitive part of the selling process. It’s actually not a single statement, question, or event. Rather, the close is an ongoing series of events that occurs throughout the selling process, according to Mary Delaney, vice president of sales for CareerBuilder.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_006">“Closing the Deal,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, May 17, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> Qualifying is the key; it’s virtually impossible to close a sale with the wrong prospect. But the preparation doesn’t stop there. The preapproach, approach, presentation, and overcoming objections all play a role in the closing the sale. According to author Ray Silverstein, the close is made in the first thirty seconds of the sales presentation. He says that’s when a customer has an emotional response to you and your product or service story. Silverstein points to research that was conducted by William Brooks and Thomas Travisano that concludes that people want to buy from people they like and trust.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_007">Ray Silverstein, “How to Close a Sale in the First 30 Seconds,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/leadership/leadershipcolumnistraysilverstein/article178590.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/leadership/leadershipcolumnistraysilverstein/article178590.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> If this sounds familiar, it should be. The concept of building a relationship based on first impressions was covered in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>. And understanding the difference between needs, which are rational, and wants, which are emotional, makes a difference in how your prospect perceives you and the message you are delivering.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p02">To demonstrate that the close takes place at virtually every point in the selling process, Daniel Sheridan from Extensis Group LLC, a sales training consultancy, says it best: “If you’re waiting for a proposal to close, it’s too late.” He goes on to say that the most important meeting is the first one because that’s when trust and rapport are established.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_008">Simona Covel, “Finding the Right People to Make the Sale,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 29, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121199448885726503.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121199448885726503.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p03">The close builds on everything that has already taken place throughout the selling process—rapport, trust, information sharing. It’s also important to know what the close is not. The close is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a high-pressure exchange between seller and buyer. It’s <em class="emphasis">not</em> a time when the salesperson resorts to trickery, manipulation, or other unsavory tactics just to get a sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_009">Geoffrey James, “Close More Sales: Train Your Sales Team,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 23, no. 8, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=6389">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=6389</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> While sales are the ultimate financial goal of the selling process, relationships, trust, and understanding a customer’s business and providing cost-effective solutions are driving factors behind making the sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_010">Ram Charan, “What Your Customer Isn’t Saying about Your Sales Pitch,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 29, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121182439378120865.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121182439378120865.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> The same principles that guide the rest of the selling process also guide the close.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p04">If closing is not a specific event that happens during the selling process, you might be wondering how you effectively get the order. You learned about the trial close in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch10#fwk-125752-ch10">Chapter 10 "The Presentation: The Power of Solving Problems"</a>. The trial close can take place during any part of the selling process. The trial close gives you the opportunity to get specific feedback from the customer as it relates to her likelihood to make the purchase at any point during the process. While the trial close is most likely to come during the presentation, it could come even earlier in the process depending on the prospect and the product or service being purchased. A trial close asks for an opinion (“What is most important to you about this product or service?”), whereas a closing question asks for a decision (“Shall we complete the paperwork?”).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_011">D. Forbes Ley, “Trial Closing Questions Tell You When to Ask for a Decision,” The Bachman Company, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bachmanco.com/pretz/PDF/Trial%20Closing%20Questions.pdf">http://www.bachmanco.com/pretz/PDF/Trial%20Closing%20Questions.pdf</a> (accessed November 18, 2009).</span> The trial close gives you the opportunity to learn what the prospect is thinking and will give you some insight as to when to make the close. In some cases, the trial close may result in a close, but if it doesn’t, the prospect’s response provides valuable insight. The trial close should be done early and often throughout the selling process. Getting the prospect’s opinion at various points throughout the process helps you determine your path and how and when you should make your close.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_012">D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s03_p01">There is an old adage in selling that says, “Always Be Closing” (ABC). This means that a salesperson should never miss the opportunity to close a sale, no matter where it occurs in the selling process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_013">Michelle Nichols, “The Two-by-Four Closing Question,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, April 19, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2007/sb20070419_586407.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2007/sb20070419_586407.htm</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> But in today’s collaborative environment, it’s better to approach closing more like “Always Be Opening” (ABO).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_014">Joe Takash, “Connect with the Buyer,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.joetakash.com/media-resource/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/independent-agent.pdf">http://www.joetakash.com/media-resource/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/independent-agent.pdf</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> In other words, the best strategy is to always be helping your customer identify and solve his problems, just like you do when you are opening the selling process. Focus on asking the right questions and learning about how you can suggest solutions (in some cases, the solution might not even be your product or service). When you deliver value to your prospect, they will look to you for advice and counsel. “You become much more than a salesperson, you become their marketing expert, a resource, an ally,” according to Mario Russo, general sales manager at radio station WBEN-FM in Philadelphia. “That’s when you are successful in selling.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_015">Mario Russo, Executive Panel in Marketing 2335—Public Relations and Publicity, Saint Joseph’s University, Philadelphia, PA, November 18, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s03_p02">It’s true that asking for the order is critical for success in selling. But if you close too soon, you might run the risk that the customer thinks that the process is over and mentally moves on to something else.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_016">Mark Hunter, “Close Too Quick and You Lose Profit,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, November 4, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/mark-hunter/sales-hunter/close-too-quick-and-you-lose-profit">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/mark-hunter/sales-hunter/close-too-quick-and-you-lose-profit</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> That’s why it is a good idea to ask <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exploratory questions</a><span class="glossdef">Open-ended, nonthreatening questions that encourage your prospect to discuss their business needs.</span></span>: open-ended, nonthreatening questions that encourage your prospect to discuss her business needs. This helps supplement the information you gathered during the preapproach, enabling you to understand what the customer needs and how to meet those needs. For example, if you are selling accounting software, you might ask the following exploratory questions: “What are the top three activities that consume your people’s time daily?” “What is the ideal way you would like your people to spend their time?” “What are the types of activities that you think can be automated?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_017">“Closing the Deal,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, May 17, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> None of these is a hard-sell question. Rather, each question allows you to listen and gather information so that you can identify how you can help the prospect solve his problem.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s03_p03">While you always have your eye on the prize of closing a sale, the focus is to extend your relationship with your prospect beyond selling to servicing and being a business partner. That’s what ABO is all about. When you focus your selling efforts in this way, it makes it easier to sell additional products and services to existing customers because you are constantly learning about ways in which you and your company can add value.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s04_p01">When you focus on delivering value to your prospects and customers, you have earned the right to close or ask for the sale. It might seem obvious, but sometimes salespeople get caught up in the selling process and lose track of the fact that it is a buying process for the prospect. Sometimes, simple questions like “Will delivery on Tuesday work for you?” or “Should we start your service the week of the twenty-first?” help you and the customer focus on moving from the sales presentation to the delivery of the product or service. The specific closing questions will most likely differ based on the product or service you are selling. For example, in pharmaceutical sales, industry sales expert Jane Williams adds, “Never end a successful close without adding the proper patient dosing.” She says, “It is very important that your physician prescribe your product properly.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_018">“Closing Arguments,” Selling Power Pharmaceuticals eNewsletter, September 11, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=648">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=648</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>

Confidence and the right mental attitude can make all the difference in being able to take all the <em class="emphasis">no</em>s on the way to <em class="emphasis">yes</em>es.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_023">Joe Takash, “Connect with the Buyer,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.joetakash.com/media-resource/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/independent-agent.pdf">http://www.joetakash.com/media-resource/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/independent-agent.pdf</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s05_p01">It’s rare that a prospect will say, “I’m ready to close this deal.” That step in the process usually belongs to the salesperson to actively close the sale. The best way to know when to close is to listen and watch. There are verbal and nonverbal cues that prospects provide that help you understand when she is ready for you to close. Here are some of the signals that the prospect is ready to buy:</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">When the prospect asks questions</strong>. It is a good time to close after answering a question.

You won’t be able to be successful closing every sale. After all, even professional baseball players only hit the ball three times out of every ten pitches to be considered above average. While hitting the ball 100 percent of the time would be considered unrealistic, every professional hitter takes batting practice to help increase his batting average.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">complex sale</a><span class="glossdef">Sale of a high-value product or service (usually over $100,000) that may take years to close.</span></span> is a term that usually refers to high-value purchases (usually $100,000 and higher). Products and services such as enterprise systems, health care providers, commercial real estate, manufacturing equipment, logistics services, and other major business-to-business (B2B) purchases are considered complex sales. These types of sales have a long selling cycle because there is a lot at stake for such a major purchase and there are multiple people involved in the decision-making process. In fact, it may take as long as six months to three years to close the sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_034">Steve Kayser, “Shooting the Donkey in the Complex Sales Process…Hollywood Style,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scottymiller.wordpress.com/category/tips-on-navigating-the-complex-sale">http://scottymiller.wordpress.com/category/tips-on-navigating-the-complex-sale</a> (accessed January 7, 2010).</span> The product or service commitment is usually a long-term commitment with a contract as long as three, five, or even ten years or longer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_p02">While the selling skills discussed throughout this book apply to complex sales, there are some differences. According to Jeff Thull, author of <em class="emphasis">Mastering the Complex Sale</em>, there are four phases to a complex sale.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Discover</strong>. As with any other sale, research about the prospect and his needs is critical to success. During the discover phase, you set the stage for the ongoing relationship or engagement. This stage includes your detailed research about the company and its current provider including several meetings and phone calls with the prospect. It is at this stage that the prospect determines whether the engagement has potential.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diagnose</strong>. In a complex sale, the decision is likely to be centered on what should be changed, such as the location of a warehouse, and includes a collaborative effort between the salesperson and the customer to determine if the change is feasible and desirable. This stage also includes extensive financial analysis to determine the impact of the decision on the company. The role of the salesperson is to be a true business partner and help the prospect understand the trade-offs and benefits of making a major change in the operation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Design</strong>. Complex sales usually involve products and services that are customized for each customer. For example, an ad campaign, software, retail fixtures, or other major purchases are adapted, adjusted, or designed exclusively for that customer. At this stage, the sales rep works closely with key people in the customer’s organization to design the best solution to fit the customer’s needs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Deliver</strong>. If the first three phases are implemented correctly, this final stage should logically follow. At this point, the key people at the customer’s organization have been involved in the design and financial justification of the product or service so the presentation of the formal proposal should lead to acceptance. Then the efforts are focused on the delivery of the product or service and implementation. For products such as software and other major purchases, there may even be training, troubleshooting, and other transition issues that are handled by the salesperson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_035">“Winning Strategies to Succeed in Complex Sales,” Prime Resource Group, March 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.masteringthecomplexsale.com/sales-training-book-press-release.htm">http://www.masteringthecomplexsale.com/sales-training-book-press-release.htm</a> (accessed January 7, 2010).</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_p03">During each of these phases, it’s important to identify all the decision makers and their positions in the process. As with every stage in the selling process, this is about asking the right questions. “How will your organization go about making this decision?” and “Who else do I need to talk to?” are good questions to ask during the discover phase so that you can get input and feedback from all involved at the beginning of the process. Once you identify all the people involved in the decision-making process, you’ll want to identify the decision makers. Again, the right questions will help you focus your efforts appropriately. Knowing to whom the expense will be charged helps you identify the ultimate authority. The person who controls the budget is most likely different from the person who will be evaluating the technical aspects of the product or service. For example, while the chief information officer may make the budget decision, the systems implementation manager may be evaluating the technical aspects of the software. Finally, you want to identify the “power broker,” the person who will ultimately make the final decision. This is usually the person, a subject-matter expert, who is the right hand of the person who controls the budget.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_036">“Ten Keys to Winning Complex High Dollar Sales,” Best-Coaching-Training.org, May 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.best-coaching-training.org/2009/05/29/ten-keys-to-winning-complex-high-dollar-sales">http://www.best-coaching-training.org/2009/05/29/ten-keys-to-winning-complex-high-dollar-sales</a> (accessed January 7, 2010).</span> In other words, you want to identify with whom you will be negotiating and ultimately closing the sale.</p>

Depending on the product, service, or prospect, some sales might be straightforward like, for example, buying a computer (“I’ll take the MacBook Pro with the fifteen-inch screen”). The price is posted and there is no room for negotiation. However in many situations, especially in business-to-business (B2B) selling, the pricing, length of contract, terms, options, delivery dates, services, and other aspects of the sale can all be negotiated. Negotiation, like selling, is a process. Following the process helps improve your chances of getting what you want.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s01_p10">It might be helpful to think about a negotiation like an iceberg. Although you can see the tip of the iceberg, it can be deceiving because it does not tell the entire story. The same is true when you are negotiating; your prospect may say something that appears to be obvious but really wants to achieve other things that are hidden below the surface. Using the process of negotiation to learn more about your prospect’s motivations and interests, you can understand what is below the tip of the iceberg. It’s usually the part of the iceberg that you can’t see that is more substantial and has more impact that the portion that is visible. When you come prepared, listen, and probe during the negotiation process, you can learn a lot about what lies below the tip of the iceberg and use this information to collaborate and eventually reach a common ground on the issues. For example, assume you are selling advertising space for a men’s magazine to the hottest new beer company. Your contact at the beer company wants to get the word out about this new brand but has a very small budget, so he doesn’t want to pay the full published rate for the ads. You don’t want to sell at less than the published rate because that will lower the value of your ad space. The tip of the iceberg shows that this is a price negotiation. However, if you ask the right questions and listen more, you will learn that his ultimate objective is to get people to taste the beer because that is the best way to get new customers. If he can get a major sampling opportunity, then he can use it to go to other media partners to get other sampling campaigns. Now you have gotten below the surface of the iceberg and understand his motivations. With this additional information that wasn’t readily visible on the surface, you can offer him an advertising package that includes ads in the magazine in addition to sampling opportunities at three upcoming national events that the magazine sponsors. Now the negotiation is focused on all parties winning by getting something they want, rather than simply negotiating on price. Getting below the surface provides valuable information and insights for negotiating.</p>

She feels strongly that the real estate business isn’t just about closing the deal—it’s about providing honest information to help customers make the decision that’s right for them. She tells prospects everything from the fact that there is structural damage on a property to whether she thinks a deal is out of their price range. “When you treat people that way they’re not only happy to give you a commission—they become raving fans,” according to Rodriguez.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_048">Polly LaBarre, “Saleswoman for the 21st Century,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/node/36271/print">http://www.fastcompany.com/node/36271/print</a> (accessed November 18, 2009).</span></p>

To do that effectively, strive to gain commitment long before you begin the formal negotiation. That means using every touch point you have at the company to help you. While you might think it is impossible to enlist others in your prospect’s company to help you sell, consider the creativity of Art Fry, the creator of 3M Post-it notes. Fry stumbled upon the semisticky adhesive years before the product was introduced after creating the first version of the product as a way to mark hymns in his hymnal at church, he started giving his new invention to secretaries and coworkers at 3M. Soon secretaries were taking the pilgrimage between buildings on the 3M corporate campus just to get more of the sticky note pads. It was the demand from the people who used the product that ultimately generated interest in marketing the product to consumers.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s03_p01">Every negotiation, whether it is in business, politics, or your personal life, includes three critical elements. Understanding the role of these elements can help make you a better negotiator.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Information</strong>. When you do your homework, research, and ask questions about what is important to your prospect, you may be able to avoid negotiating on price all together. If you have information, and share information at the appropriate time, you can make a negotiation a huge win for everyone.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_054">Herb Cohen, <em class="emphasis">You Can Negotiate Anything</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1980), 19.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Power</strong>. According to Herb Cohen, known as the world’s best negotiator, power is based on perception. If you perceive you have the power to influence your situation, you do (conversely, if you don’t believe you have the power, you don’t).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_055">Herb Cohen, <em class="emphasis">You Can Negotiate Anything</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1980), 20.</span>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Time</strong>. Time is the great negotiator. Ninety percent of all negotiating occurs during the last 10 percent of the set time frame. Deadlines force decisions to be made and negotiations to come to fruition. Use time to your advantage by never revealing your deadline.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Everything Is Negotiable</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s04_p01">Many salespeople are afraid of negotiating. They are worried that they won’t be up to the challenge to persuade someone to do what they want or to pay their price. Confidence and preparation go a long way to achieving a satisfactory result on both sides. Negotiating and closing are ways of gaining agreement. The old saying goes, “Everything is negotiable,” and it’s true. Your prospect believes the same thing so be prepared to negotiate about virtually every aspect of the sale. For less complex sales, the close might come as a result of a simple question at the end of the presentation. However, for more complex sales, there are various elements of the sale that must be agreed upon to close the sale. Elements such as price, length of contract, service, terms, and options are common points to be negotiated as part of the close.</p>

            <h3 class="title">One for All</h3>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s04_p02">Negotiations in B2B selling usually require multiple parties to be involved from both companies. You may find yourself negotiating one-on-one with a prospect or being a member of a negotiating team that works with a prospect team to negotiate a deal. Either way, the same principles of negotiating apply.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s04_p03">Many salespeople are concerned about negotiating price. They think that lowering the price will make the sale. In fact, price is rarely the motivating factor behind any purchase. That’s not to say that price isn’t important, but customers buy <em class="emphasis">value</em>, not price. If price were always the determining factor in purchases, premium brand such as Porsche, Apple, and Neiman Marcus would not exist. If you’ve ever shopped at Nordstrom, Banana Republic, or Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, you decided that those retailers offered more value than Old Navy, eBay, or Wal-Mart for the item you bought. Price is a part of the value equation but not all of it. According to author Kelley Robertson, “Everything you say and do from the first contact with a prospect affects the value of your product or service in their mind.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_057">Kelley Robertson, “Let’s Make a Deal: Negotiating Techniques,” The EyesOnSales Blog, January 18, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.eyesonsales.com/content/article/lets_make_a_deal_negotiating_techniques">http://www.eyesonsales.com/content/article/lets_make_a_deal_negotiating_techniques</a> (accessed November 19, 2009).</span> That means establishing value with your presentation, demonstration, testimonials, follow-up, and everything that comes before the actual negotiation.

(Are you willing to provide additional services rather than provide a price concession? Will shorter payment terms help your prospect be able to sign on the dotted line?)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s05_s01_p04">It’s a good idea to realize that your prenegotiation goals should not be the same offer you put on the table. Always allow some negotiating room as the first offer is rarely, if ever, accepted. Your prospect wants to feel as if she was able to get you to move from your original position. When you identify your prenegotiation goals, you know where you may end up, and also give yourself some room to negotiate.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_063">John Hoult, “Negotiation 101,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, September 30, 2000, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/articles/2000/10/act_podziba.html?page=0%2C0">http://www.fastcompany.com/articles/2000/10/act_podziba.html?page=0%2C0</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>

Although you have done your homework and set your prenegotiation goals, hold firm on your initial offer. This allows you to learn more about what your prospect thinks is important and why. If you give in too early in the process, your prospect will feel like the negotiation was too easy and may have an expectation of getting even more concessions than you are willing to give. The general rule of negotiating is not to accept the first offer. That means you will need to reiterate the value you deliver and hold firm to your initial offer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_064">Anthony Tjan, “Four Rules of Effective Negotiations,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, July 28, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/tjan/2009/07/four-rules-for-effective-negot.html">http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/tjan/2009/07/four-rules-for-effective-negot.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>

But for every concession you give, get one in return. For example, “I’ll be able to look at pricing like this if we were able to be your exclusive distributor in the Northeast.” This is an example of using other “currencies” to make the negotiation work. In this case, the currency of exclusivity is used in exchange for a price concession.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_065">Anthony Tjan, “Four Rules of Effective Negotiations,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, July 28, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/tjan/2009/07/four-rules-for-effective-negot.html">http://blogs.harvardbusiness.org/tjan/2009/07/four-rules-for-effective-negot.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s02_s05_s02_p03">Specificity is key in negotiating and closing, because once an issue is negotiated, it will be difficult to revisit it. Define each negotiated point in specific terms such as the number of days until delivery, specific payment terms, options that are clearly spelled out, and any other information that will clearly define your agreement. In most cases, all these elements are included in the contract that is signed as a result of the negotiation. It’s always best to clarify each point during the negotiation and put it on paper to avoid misconceptions, bad memories, or surprises down the road. If there is no contract, it’s a good idea to follow up the negotiation with a written summary of the agreed upon points.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_066">“Customers’ Negotiating Tactics,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, July 1, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=212">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=212</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>

You may find a way to include the thorny issue in a concession for a different negotiating point. It’s not worth getting held up on points during the negotiation; simply set them aside and revisit them at a later point in the negotiation. When you leave the most difficult issues until the end, other issues have already been resolved and both parties are motivated to find a resolution.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_067">RCM Staff Report, “27 Principles of Negotiating with a Meeting Facility,” MeetingsNet, February 1, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://meetingsnet.com/ar/meetings_principles_negotiating">http://meetingsnet.com/ar/meetings_principles_negotiating</a> (accessed November 19, 2009).</span></p>

Many times you have the opportunity to meet at least one or two people at the company, usually someone in human resources as well as your hiring manager. In some cases, you may meet with several different people with whom you will be working. In some cases, you may also talk with or meet with a recruiter. At any rate, you have the opportunity to establish your value with as many people as you meet. Everything you say and do has an impact on how people perceive you and your value. Are your résumé and cover letter professional? Did you do your research before you contacted the employer? How did you make contact? When you went in for an interview, did you dress appropriately and professionally? Were you prepared for the interview? Did you bring samples of your work to demonstrate your skills? Did you follow up with a thank-you e-mail and handwritten thank-you note within twenty-four hours? All these elements help establish your value long before an offer is extended.

The high-risk environment of a start-up might provide exactly the right place for you to start your career. But enter the business with your eyes wide open. “There’s no shortage of start-ups to work for, but most are going to fail,” says Greg Carney of Carney-Neuhaus.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_076">Dona DeZube, “Negotiating Compensation for a Job at a Startup,” Monster.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://career-advice.monster.com/salary-benefits/negotiation-tips/negotiating-compensation-startup/article.aspx">http://career-advice.monster.com/salary-benefits/negotiation-tips/negotiating-compensation-startup/article.aspx</a> (accessed November 22, 2009).</span> This article provides insight about how to structure compensation with a start-up company.</p>

(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 202.</span> Just as in the selling process, you want to put focus on establishing your value and learning about what’s important to your prospective employer before you begin discussing compensation. A word of caution: you should be prepared to give your desired salary range on an interview as many employers want to understand your salary expectations as soon as possible. If you can avoid the topic, do so until you receive a job offer. Here’s an example of how you can deflect the conversation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s03_p06">It’s worth noting the time element of this negotiation. You should take as much time as you need to evaluate the offer, but you should be reasonable and state the time frame you need. Recall from earlier in this chapter that time is one of the elements that is always present in a negotiation. Sometimes a prospective employer or recruiter will try to create a deadline to force you to make a decision by a specific date. Use time to your advantage and negotiate for more time so that you don’t feel as if you are under pressure to make this important decision.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s04_p01">Congratulations on your offer! Although it’s a difficult economy, don’t feel pressured to take the first offer you get. Take the first offer you get for a job you really want. This is a special moment; it is the time when the power shifts from the prospective employer to you (remember that power is one of the elements that is always present in a negotiation). Your prospective employer has now indicated that you are their choice for the position. You have the opportunity to take the offer, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">counteroffer</a><span class="glossdef">A candidate’s response to a job offer.</span></span> (your response to the job offer), or walk away. Whatever your choice, you have the power. As soon as you make your choice, the power shifts back to your prospective employer. That’s why it’s a good idea to take your time and completely evaluate your offer before you respond.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s04_p02">Now that you have all the elements of the offer, you can begin to evaluate it.

If you think the offer is perfect as is, then accept it as is. Keep in mind that many employers expect candidates to negotiate by presenting a counteroffer, a candidate’s response to a job offer. Since the economy is challenging, candidates don’t have as much bargaining power as when the economy is healthy. However, this is the time you have the most negotiating power with your prospective employer so it’s a good idea to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s05_p02">This is the time when you should identify your prenegotiation goals. Remember that your prenegotiation goals are the minimum that you will accept. Your counteroffer will be above your prenegotiation goals to allow room for negotiation. You won’t be able to negotiate every element of the offer. Choose one or two key areas and focus your negotiation on those. Keep in mind the things that are important to you and to your prospective employer so that you can easily find common ground. For example, if speed and availability are important to your prospective employer, you may want to use that fact to negotiate a more flexible work arrangement. While it may be difficult to negotiate a higher base salary in this economy, you may be able to negotiate on another area such as getting additional vacation time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_081">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s05_p03">When you have identified the areas you wish to negotiate along with your counteroffer for each, contact the recruiter or prospective employer to begin the negotiation. As with any negotiation, approach it with a confident, collaborative attitude. It’s important to note that you should not accept the offer until you negotiate the offer. Once you accept the offer, you have lost your power to negotiate.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s06_p01">Once you agree on the final elements of the offer, you should ask for an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">offer letter</a><span class="glossdef">A formal letter from the company (on company letterhead) that outlines the terms of the offer for employment.</span></span>, a formal letter from the company (on company letterhead) that outlines the terms of the offer. All companies should provide an offer letter as a matter of course for an internship (paid or unpaid) or a job offer. If you received the original offer in the form of a letter, you already have the offer letter; however, you should request an updated letter to reflect the final offer on which you agreed. If you find any discrepancies in your offer letter, contact the person at the company as soon as possible to have a new offer letter issued.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s06_p02">A offer letter simply reiterates the terms of employment that you have negotiated and may be conditional based on requirements such as a background check or drug test or may make reference to company documents such as the benefits summary or employee handbook. While some information in offer letters may vary depending on the company, some key information should be included in the offer letter:</p>

            <li>Title</li>
            <li>Salary</li>
            <li>Bonus</li>
            <li>All other elements of compensation (e.g., stock options, benefits)</li>
            <li>Start date</li>
            <li>Any conditions of employment</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s06_p03">Some companies request that you sign a copy of the offer letter and return it to the company. If this is the case, sign the letter and make a copy for your files before returning it to the company. The offer letter is your documentation of the compensation the company has agreed to give you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_082">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed.

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Salary</strong> is only one element of total <strong class="emphasis bold">compensation</strong>. Use all elements of compensation to creatively negotiate to get what you want.</li>
                <li>Avoid discussing <strong class="emphasis bold">compensation</strong> as long as possible; don’t bring it up unless the interviewer brings it up. Your goal on every interview is to establish your value so that your offer reflects what you are worth.</li>
                <li>Before you begin <strong class="emphasis bold">negotiating</strong> a job offer, be sure you understand all the elements of the offer.</li>
                <li>Carefully evaluate an internship or job offer based on what is important to you including the offer as well as other aspects of the job and company.</li>
                <li>Identify one or two elements of a job offer that you want to negotiate. Determine your <strong class="emphasis bold">prenegotiation goals</strong> for each and approach your prospective employer to discuss each element. Focus on what is important to the company as you negotiate each point.</li>
                <li>The final offer that you accept should be documented in an <strong class="emphasis bold">offer letter</strong>. Whether you are being offered an internship (paid or unpaid) or a full-time job, the company should provide an offer letter within a few days of your acceptance of the offer.</li>

You try to include new products that reflect the eating trends of the students. One of the trends is for more natural and organic food choices. The challenge is that, in order to offer new menu options, some of the existing options need to be eliminated. Any new products must be able to generate more revenue than existing items at a lower cost. You are especially interested in increasing sales at the snack bars with impulse items like individually wrapped cookies and cakes. The Organic Delight Desserts option is exactly what you are looking for, but the price is too high, and you’re not sure you want all the flavors that come packed together in one case. The price from the sales rep is $20 per case. There are four flavors packed in a case—chocolate, strawberry, lemon, and mocha. At this rate, you might only put this in your top ten schools. If you can get a better price with the option to order individual flavors by the case, you might consider putting the line in all three hundred colleges and universities.</p>

These cookies and mini cakes are individually wrapped and are an excellent impulse item, or ideal for cafeterias. Since this is a new product line, it would be ideal to get placement with ProFood because it could lead to distribution at hundreds of schools. You just need to sell the purchasing manager on the line. You have sampled the products, and she likes the taste and thinks the packaging is perfect for her schools. Now you are down to negotiating on price and packaging. You have quoted $20 a case for a case that includes all four flavors—chocolate, strawberry, lemon, and mocha. You might have some flexibility to have a custom cases made up in each flavor so she can order only the flavors she wants. However, it will cost additional handling to do that.</p>

            <li>If you do your prospecting and qualifying correctly, you can significantly improve the number of times you are able to close a sale.</li>
            <li>A trial close is when you ask your prospect their opinion. A close is when you ask for a decision.</li>
            <li>When the prospect is demonstrating positive body language, when the prospect asks questions, and after you handle an objection.</li>
            <li>“Would you like to preorder Guitar Hero Van Halen or take Guitar Hero Metallica with you now?”</li>
            <li>Negotiating is based on trust. If your prospect doesn’t trust you, chances are she will be unwilling to compromise and find common ground during the negotiation.</li>
            <li>Information, power, and time.</li>
            <li>Forty percent of prospects ask for a lower price. Salespeople should work to get below the surface and understand the prospect’s true needs. Prospects are looking for value, not necessarily price. Salespeople should demonstrate the value of their product or service and negotiate on other elements rather than price. Reducing the price decreases profit, commission, and value of the product or service in the mind of the prospect.</li>
            <li>A concession is something on which you are willing to compromise such as price, service, terms, options, or other elements of the deal. It’s best to get a concession when you give a concession.</li>
            <li>Prenegotiation, negotiation, and postnegotiation.</li>
            <li>Goals that you identify before the beginning of a negotiation that establish the minimum that you are willing to accept to make the deal happen.</li>
            <li>False.</li>
            <li>Do research before beginning your job search by visiting Web sites that include salary information.</li>
            <li>Salary is only one portion of total compensation, payment for services provided to an employer. There are several elements of compensation, including salary, vacation, insurance, hours, travel, relocation, and others that can be used to increase the total value of your job offer.</li>
