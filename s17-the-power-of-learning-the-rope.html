You don’t have to be a celebrity or a person who went to Harvard, according to blogger Auren Hoffman in her April 2009 post “The A-Player Janitor”: “An ‘A-Player’ by definition is incredibly productive and smart and has that ‘it,’ that rockstar-esque factor that makes everyone want to work with her.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_001">Valeria Maltoni, “How Do You Become an A-Player?” Social Media Today, April 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/85675">http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/85675</a> (accessed September 4, 2009).</span> Her point is that hiring managers want to hire the best person for every job.

This exciting, unstructured, and sometimes unpredictable environment rarely gets boring. But it’s this lack of structure that can present a challenge in choosing priorities and accomplishing goals. Those who are successful realize how to manage themselves and their time and use the resources that are available to them from their company, their colleagues, and their community.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_p02">You might be wondering what managing yourself means. When you are in sales, one of the most important jobs you have is being sure that you have clear direction about what you want to accomplish and what you need to do to get there. Even though you are used to managing yourself and your time at school, it can be a daunting task to be responsible for calling on customers and generating sales, especially if you are based in a location remote from the company office such as your home office. So first things first—identify your resources. Even though you’re traveling solo, you are not alone.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s01_p01">One of the best ways to learn the ropes and get the inside track is to go on ride-alongs (also referred to as shadowing) with colleagues, traveling with an experienced sales rep or sales manager to make sales calls. The video ride-alongs at the start of each chapter are a virtual way for you to get some powerful insights from experienced sales professionals. Sometimes a ride-along is included in the interviewing process; it’s an opportunity for you to experience firsthand exactly what the job entails and for the company to see how you react in the selling environment before you get a job offer. Other times a ride-along is an training opportunity that takes place after you’ve been hired. Either way, always take advantage of as many opportunities as you can to ride-along with experienced salespeople. There are some tips that will help maximize your ride-along experience.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Always be professional</strong>. It is likely that you will be traveling with a salesperson or sales manager at least for a day and sometimes for a week or longer. Even though you will get to know each other, always remember your role on the ride-along.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid highly personal or inappropriate topics</strong>. While it’s always appropriate to tell the truth, it’s best to avoid controversial topics, especially as they relate to the company.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Mind your manners and avoid alcohol if you go out to lunch or dinner</strong>. Since you will ultimately be in the role of entertaining clients, the person with whom you are riding will undoubtedly be watching your social behavior.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p01">Many salespeople don’t realize that their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sales manager</a><span class="glossdef">Person to whom a salesperson reports and who is accountable for delivering on sales goals.</span></span> (i.e., the person to whom they report) is ultimately responsible for delivering the company’s sales goals. As such, the sales manager wants to do everything he can to help his salespeople be successful. Even before you start your job, it’s a good idea to touch base with your sales manager. Chances are you interviewed with him, so you probably have his contact information. A good way to get off to a great start is to send him a handwritten thank-you note after you’ve accepted the position. What better way to start a new relationship than with a personal note.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p02">Your sales manager can be your most important source of company information as well as customer insights. He had a lot of experience selling before he became a sales manager, and he would likely share his insights to help you be successful. Not only can he make your job (and your life) easier, he can teach you a lot about selling. It’s always a good idea to keep your sales manager updated with the status of your customers and prospects. He will appreciate your proactive and regular updates about the standing of each lead and customer in addition to your regular one-on-one meetings, staff meetings, or conference calls.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p03">Sometimes new salespeople are nervous about asking questions of their sales managers, which is natural. It’s best to remember that your sales manager doesn’t expect you to know everything. Your questions show him that you are interested in learning more about the business from him and help him identify what areas would be most beneficial for coaching. Your sales manager can be a part of your success story. Ask questions, ask his opinion, keep him in the loop, help make him look good, and you will have a relationship that works and grows.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p04">Just as communication is important with customers, it is critical to building your relationship with your sales manager. He probably has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">span of control</a><span class="glossdef">The number of people that report to one manager.</span></span>, or the number of people reporting to him, ranging from a two to twenty or more people. It’s important to understand the organizational structure of a sales department. While each company is different, the basic structure of a selling organization is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_f01">Figure 14.2 "Sales Department Organization Chart"</a>. In some companies, salespeople may be responsible for a city or cities, region, or other geographic area. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">territory management</a><span class="glossdef">Organizational strategy whereby salespeople are responsible for a designated geographic area such as a city or cites, state, or region.</span></span>. In this case, salespeople, usually called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">territory managers</a><span class="glossdef">Salesperson that is reponsible for the customers in a designated geographic area.</span></span>, are responsible for the customers in their specific geographic area. This organizational strategy helps minimize the amount of travel time between customers.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p05">In other companies, salespeople may be responsible for specific brands, products, or product categories. In the case of food manufacturers, these categories might be noncarbonated beverages, prepared meals, or dairy products. In the professional services arena, the organization might be vertical, such as retail sales, financial services, or health care. This product or category approach may require salespeople to travel to customers in various parts of the country based on the needs of the customers. It requires the salesperson to develop expertise in a specific product or discipline. These sales positions may have titles such as account manager, product manager, or sales rep. The different types of sales positions are discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Resources and Resourcefulness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s03_p01">The company you work for, whether it is large or small, has resources. A laptop, the customer relationship management (CRM) system, your expense account, the company owner, the human resources department, accounts receivable department, and others are all resources that can help you do your job. Take the time to explore all the resources when you start with the company. In larger companies, you will most likely participate in an orientation session or process frequently referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">onboarding</a><span class="glossdef">Employee orientation process or method for a new employee to learn about company practices, policies, and procedures.</span></span> to learn about how the company operates and how your can take advantage of resources to help you do your job. In a small company, the process is less formal and requires you to be more proactive about understanding what’s available. Either way, it’s your responsibility to explore and understand your resources. Remember that all the skills you use when you are communicating with customers are the same when you are communicating inside your company: build lasting relationships that are mutually beneficial. While every company is different, here are some internal resources that are available in most companies.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Human resources department</strong>. Whether you work for a large company or a start-up, it’s a good idea to know the key people in HR. Chances are, you interviewed with someone in the department, but don’t stop there. Continue your relationship by learning who handles employee relations (for questions about the company policies or an ethical dilemma) and who handles benefits (for questions about medical, dental, other insurance, 401(k) plan, and other company benefits).</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Finance department</strong>. You’ll want to get to know the people who handle accounts receivable. Since most salespeople are responsible for collections, you will most likely be working closely with people in finance, accounting, or accounts payable. They can provide helpful information about company processes and policies for payment of invoices. You’re not the first person to be challenged by customer payment issues, so take advantage of their knowledge and experience.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Procurement or product development department</strong>. Whether you are selling a product or a service, you will want to know those who make the decisions about exactly what will be available for sale. Customers may have specific questions about the performance of the product or service that you may need some additional information to answer. In addition, building a relationship with people in this department will help give you insight into what will be available in the future. More important, it will help you provide input and feedback based on the customer’s perspective.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Marketing department</strong>. The people who are responsible for getting the word out about your company’s brand are important to know. You can get insights about advertising, promotions, and other communication activities. You can also get important information about future plans and help shape the marketing plan for the future based on your experience with customers.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Information technology department</strong>. Everything from your laptop to your reports is supported in the IT department. It’s especially important to get to know the people who man the help desk. Chances are, you will have a technology emergency at some point in time so it’s best to build a strong relationship from the start.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other salespeople</strong>. Create relationships with the best-performing salespeople so you can learn the best practices. Go on ride-alongs and learn what makes them successful.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other resources</strong>. Explore the CRM system and company intranet, especially the online communities. This is an excellent way to learn about how sales were won, see examples of successful proposals, and learn about best practices of the top performers.</li>

Knight used comic books as his inspiration and got employees involved in telling the Hard Rock Café story; all the illustrations and photos in the handbook were done by Hard Rock employees.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p01">Depending on the type of business you are in and the company you work for, you might have as few as one customer and as many as a hundred or more. You might be wondering how you determine which customers to call on each day, how much time should be spent on prospecting versus calling on existing customers, how much time should be devoted to nonselling activities such as travel, paperwork, and internal meetings. While there is no hard-and-fast answer to these questions, your goal should be to spend as much time as possible with customers or prospects. It’s impossible to sell if you are not in front of a customer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p02">Consider this: Salespeople spend approximately fourteen hours a week engaged in face-to-face selling. That means that 70 percent of the time, in an average forty-six-hour workweek, salespeople are doing something other than face-to-face selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_009">Gerald L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p03">Since your objective is to spend as much time as possible with customers, you’ll need to balance where you physically spend your time and with which customers you spend it. This is where territory management strategies come into play. Based on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">call cycle</a><span class="glossdef">The frequency at which you call on each of your customers (e.g., once every twenty days).</span></span>, the frequency at which you call on each of your customers, and where each is located, you’ll develop a plan to call on your existing customers and allow time for prospecting. In other words, you will need to have a plan to invest your time wisely to meet your goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p04">To plan your sales calls, you’ll need a map (Google maps or MapQuest) and sales and potential sales information by customer (your company CRM system should include some, if not all, of this information), and your call cycle. Identify the location of each of your customers with a red dot or push pin. Then, divide your territory into sections by geography (designated as one, two, three, etc.), this can become the basis of your territory management plan. Review your customer data, including current sales and potential sales, to organize and prioritize your customers and calls. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_f02">Figure 14.4 "Territory Management Worksheet"</a> includes an example of a territory management worksheet.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p05">Based on this, you would plan your route so that you are making calls in one section of your territory on a given day, then covering another section on another day. This will ensure that you regularly visit your best customers and those with the most potential for growth, minimizing your travel time. While this might seem like a lot of work to do, it will save you time in the long run and help you increase your sales…and your income.</p>

Salespeople get paid on results, not on the number of hours worked. As a salesperson, there are so many demands on your time: client needs, internal meetings, follow-ups, proposals, phone calls, e-mails, text messages, and the emergency du jour. All these can be time thieves, or activities that literally steal your time away from selling. You can easily fill your days with demanding tasks like these that really do not bring value to customers or ultimately close sales. Keep in mind that according to renowned sales consultant and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar, “Nothing happens until someone sells something.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_011">Ann Devine, “Is a Career in Sales Right for You?” The Black Collegian, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.black-collegian.com/career/career-reports/sales-grad05.shtml">http://www.black-collegian.com/career/career-reports/sales-grad05.shtml</a> (accessed August 19, 2009).</span> To understand how to avoid getting caught up in the daily sea of details, it’s a good idea to realize why these interruptions and administrative demands consume your day. Here are three key reasons that time can get away from you:</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Poor planning</strong>. Avoid getting caught up in the moment and make a plan every day of selling activities—not time-fillers—that you want to accomplish. True selling activities include things like identifying six new prospects, setting up three appointments for the coming week, or closing at least one sale. “Write your top three outcomes at the top of your plan” is good advice.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_012">John Hacking, “Time Management for Sales People,” Buzzle.com, October 15, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/time-management-for-sales-people.html">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/time-management-for-sales-people.html</a> (accessed September 5, 2009).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Procrastination</strong>. Fear of rejection causes many salespeople to stay involved in meaningless tasks. It’s hard to get an appointment with a customer, as they don’t always have time to give to salespeople. Customers want true solutions, not a sales pitch. It takes time, research, and creativity to really understand a customers’ business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_013">“Procrastination Costing Your Sales Team,” ArticlesBase, April 29, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.articlesbase.com/education-articles/procrastination-costing-your-sales-team-893170.html">http://www.articlesbase.com/education-articles/procrastination-costing-your-sales-team-893170.html</a> (accessed September 5, 2009).</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Making tasks too big</strong>. Thinking about how long it takes to go from identifying a prospect to actually closing a sale can sometimes make the job seem overwhelming.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p01">Now you can see why managing yourself, managing your time, and understanding compensation plans are so important to success in sales. All these elements are linked to the company’s goals, which ultimately determine your sales goals. For example, if the company is planning a 6 percent sales increase for the year, each salesperson is responsible for delivering a certain portion of that increase. Since some salespeople are new, their goals will undoubtedly be less than those salespeople who have been at the company long enough to develop customer relationships and steady income streams.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p02">The most important aspect of sales is to understand your sales goals: exactly what is expected and by when. Most companies establish annual sales goals or quotas, expectations of sales for a specific time frame, by salesperson, and then break down the goals by month and sometimes by week. Establishing specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) sales goals (covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch08#fwk-125752-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Preapproach: The Power of Preparation"</a>) provides a clear set of expectations for the salesperson and the company. For example, a SMART sales goal is “to increase dollar sales of accounting software with current customers by 8 percent by December 31, 2011.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p03">When this goal is broken down by month and by week, it provides a way to measure progress regularly. More important, the SMART goal provides a method by which to have a regular conversation with your sales manager to discuss how to remove barriers or gain access to additional resources to achieve the goal. SMART goals become the basis of sales quotas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p04">Since many business-to-business (B2B) sales have a long sales cycle, many companies use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a><span class="glossdef">Measures of productivity that relate to achieving goals.</span></span> to help gauge the productivity of each salesperson. KPIs might be compared to miles per gallon; they are a measure of efficiency and effectiveness. So while sales or gross profit might be included in a SMART goal, KPIs provide insights into performance; they can act as a way to diagnose problems in the selling process. KPIs are used to evaluate performance and compensation. Results are how salespeople are evaluated and paid. If a salesperson is not generating the desired results, chances are he won’t last long in his position at that company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p05">KPIs may be organized by type of goal—performance KPIs or conversion KPIs. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Performance KPIs</a><span class="glossdef">Measures of productivity that include outcomes, such as sales, new accounts, units sold, or gross profit percent.</span></span> are those that include outcomes such as sales, new accounts, units sold, or gross profit percent. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conversion KPIs</a><span class="glossdef">Measure of a salesperson’s productivity or efficiency that do not have outcomes, such as sales per customer or closing ratio.</span></span> are used as a measure of a salesperson’s productivity or efficiency but do not have outcomes.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p01">It was Super Bowl Sunday in 2005, and the New England Patriots were playing the Philadelphia Eagles. Everything was perfect for New England Patriots linebacker Tedy Bruschi as he waited with excited anticipation before the game, visualizing its outcome. Talk about pressure—the Patriots had a chance to win their third Super Bowl. He played with his young sons, both under the age of five at the time, on the field hours before game time; it was great that his wife Heidi came to the Alltel Stadium with the boys early so that he had some time with them before the game. He was motivated by more than simply winning this historic game; he wanted to show his sons that you can do anything you set out to do.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p02">The game, like the day, could not have been more perfect for Bruschi. He had a sack, seven tackles, and an interception. He was only one story in a team filled with winners. The final score was 24–21, Patriots. They had done it!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p03">It was almost impossible to go to sleep that night. In fact, Bruschi didn’t get to bed until 4:00 a.m. and then was up at the crack of dawn (literally) to appear on <em class="emphasis">Good Morning America</em>. The next few days were nonstop celebrations, interviews, and photographs. Life was indescribably good.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p04">On February 16, 2005, just ten days later, Bruschi awoke at 4:00 a.m. with a headache and numbness in his body that was so severe that he had to crawl to the bathroom. Seven hours later things went from bad to worse when his vision blurred and he could no longer move his arm or leg. At the hospital he learned that he had had a stroke.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_046">Tedy Bruschi with Michael Holley, <em class="emphasis">Never Give Up: My Stroke, My Recovery &amp; My Return to the NFL</em> (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2007).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p05">After an agonizing recovery, eight months later Bruschi returned to the game he loved. He battled back to the field and played for four more seasons before retiring in August 2009. His teammate Larry Izzo said of Bruschi, “To come back from his stroke in ’05 and play four more seasons at such a high level, was nothing less than amazing. When I think of Tedy Bruschi, I think of his toughness, his courage, the passion and desire he played with, and his production. He made plays. He was a true warrior. The heart and soul of our team.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_047">Karen Guregian, “Tedy Bruschi a Role Model to Pats, Fans,” <em class="emphasis">Boston Herald</em>, September 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view/20090901tedy_bruschi_a_role_model_to_pats_fans">http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/patriots/view/20090901tedy_bruschi_a_role_model_to_pats_fans</a> (accessed September 7, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s01_p06">What motivated Bruschi? It would have been enough just to survive a stroke, but to come back and play football at a professional level is almost unthinkable. Most players don’t ever make the cut to play in the NFL, but Bruschi survived a life-threatening stroke and came back to play at the top of his game. His passion, drive, and will to survive and win outpaced even his physical challenges.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s02_s02_p02">Is being successful in sales as easy as having a great song or a catchy slogan? Not really. In fact, the White Sox were far from being the favorites at the beginning of the season. After all, eighty-eight years is a long time to go without a championship. No one really believed they could do it. But even when others might not see your vision, you have to believe in yourself even when things don’t go your way. Successful sales professionals will tell you that’s what it takes to make it in sales: an unwavering belief in yourself that you can achieve the goals you set. Hard work? Absolutely. Setbacks? Just about every day. Believing in yourself? As they say, priceless.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_049">Priceless.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.priceless.com/us/personal/en/index.html">http://www.priceless.com/us/personal/en/index.html</a> (accessed September 7, 2009).</span></p>

            <li>Take pictures of your top ten customers and top ten prospects. Put the pictures in clear view (your computer wallpaper, on your cell phone, on your refrigerator) along with your SMART goal for each one. This visual reminder will help you stay focused.</li>
            <li>Tell your family how you are going to celebrate together when you become the number one salesperson at your company. You will make your goal real by telling someone close to you, and you will have their support to get through the challenging days.</li>
            <li>Invest fifteen minutes every day to read articles, books, blogs, listen to podcasts, or view videos about your industry or the selling profession. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sellingpower.com/">Sellingpower.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.com/msg/publications/smm.jsp">Salesandmarketing.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bnet.com">bnet.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://saleshq.monster.com">SalesHQ.com</a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesvantage.com">SalesVantage.com</a> are all excellent sources of information about selling.</li>

To overcome the feeling of failure especially on daily sales calls, she suggests the “rocking chair test”: will you remember that someone said no to you today when you are sitting in a rocking chair fifty years from now? “Don’t get upset over the small stuff” is her advice to salespeople. “If you want something you never had, you must do something you’ve never done, and that may result in some failures, but a lot of successes.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651591">Lisa Peskin, “Top 10 Secrets of Selling in a Recession,” <em class="emphasis">Philadelphia Business Journal</em> Workshop, Philadelphia, PA, July 29, 2009.</span></p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Eat a healthy breakfast</strong>. You might think you don’t have time, but it’s best to make time to eat breakfast. It provides fuel to start your day. A healthy breakfast can be fast and easy, especially if you plan it the night before. Oatmeal with almonds, cold cereal with fruit, a smoothie with fruit, low-fat yogurt and wheat germ, and even cold veggie pizza can be a healthy breakfast. You owe it to yourself to start right.

You might be tempted to do the small things first so you can scratch them off you list.

It’s a good idea to make a list of all the things that are causing stress in your life. Review them and identify which ones you have control over and develop an action plan to take control over that element. For those over which you don’t have control, don’t stress.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Take time for yourself</strong>. Chances are you have multiple responsibilities and demands including work, family, school, community, and others. Even though you want to do it all, it’s a good idea to schedule some time for yourself regularly. Do something that you enjoy whether it is reading a book, going to the mall, or taking a bike ride.

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_p01">When Jay Leno was young, he saw a Mercedes/Rolls-Royce dealership in his hometown in Boston and thought it would be a great place to work given his passion for cars. When he applied for a job the manager responded with the usual: “We’re not hiring right now.” Leno was undaunted; the next Monday morning he returned and went to the car wash bay. He told them he was the new guy and started washing cars. A few days later, the manager saw him and said, “What’s he doing here?” The head of the car wash team said he was a hard worker; Leno said that he figured he would work there until he got hired. Needless to say, he got the job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_073">Jay Leno, “Jay Leno Says: Persistence Pays Off,” <em class="emphasis">Parade</em>, September 6, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2009/09/jay-leno-persistance-pays-off.html">http://www.parade.com/celebrity/2009/09/jay-leno-persistance-pays-off.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

Even in this difficult economy, there are opportunities to demonstrate your passion and skills and set yourself apart, just like Jay Leno did. Finding the right job requires focus, time management, and motivation…and sometimes even working for free. You have to keep a positive mental attitude throughout your search and manage your time to gain experience while you are going to school. Here are two key things that you can do every day to help you get the job you want: internships and professional organizations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s01_p02">An internship, or more than one internship over the course of your academic career, can provide insight into an industry or a specific company or position. What better way to learn about something you might want to do during your career…or not want to do. (Some internships teach you what you don’t want to do during your career, which is as valuable as learning what you want to do.) Internships are almost the norm today, and many employers expect to hire recent grads for entry-level positions who have had some kind of internship. “There is no such thing as too much experience, just not enough,” says Craig Bollig, a journalism major at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_075">Anya Kamenetz, “Take This Internship and Shove It,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 30, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/30/opinion/30kamenetz.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/30/opinion/30kamenetz.html</a> (accessed September 11, 2009).</span></p>

First, stop by your campus career center. The people there are skilled at helping you understand the options that are available and can provide insight as to how to find the right internship to help you meet your career objectives. And most campuses include internship postings on the campus Web site. It’s a good idea to take the time to learn all about your internship options.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s01_p05">Consider an internship the same way you would consider a job: Is this the right fit for my experience and skills? Are the company values in line with my personal values? What will I be doing? Who will I report to? Will I be paid for the internship? If so, how much? How will I be evaluated during the internship? What is the possibility of getting a full-time position after graduation? While the interview process is usually more abbreviated for an internship than for a full-time job, take the time to ask questions so you understand the expectations of the role.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Right Internship for You</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s01_s01_p01">Internships come in all shapes and sizes; some are formal, structured programs while others are created by the student. Either way, here are some considerations when you are pursuing an internship:</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s01_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Paid versus unpaid</strong>. Some, but not all, internships include a paycheck. Many large corporations have structured internship programs that include paid internships. However, many industries such as advertising, entertainment, and public relations offer unpaid internships as a way for you to gain experience. So you want to make some money and gain some experience in the field of your choice? You might be able to do both since approximately half of all internships are paid. But in today’s challenging job market, you might find it worth your while to accept an unpaid internship. While that might be a tough pill to swallow, consider Lindsey Roberts’s point of view after she graduated with an MBA from a top business school, “I could either sit at home all day and drive myself nuts going from company websites, to Indeed.com and back to Gmail and Facebook, or I could get out there, put my education and experience to work while I continued my job search.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_078">Lindsey Roberts, “A Millennial’s View on Cost/Benefits of an Unpaid Internship Post-MBA,” Millennial Marketing, August 10, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://millennialmarketing.com/2009/08/a-millennial%E2%80%99s-view-on-costbenefits-of-an-unpaid-internship-post-mba">http://millennialmarketing.com/2009/08/a-millennial’s-view-on-costbenefits-of-an-unpaid-internship-post-mba</a> (accessed September 11, 2009).</span> It’s not only graduate students who are accepting unpaid internships. According to the <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, the recession has tightened the internship market; experienced workers who have been laid off are now successfully participating in unpaid internships for the same reasons students do: to build their résumés and increase their chances for full-time work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_079">Sarah H. Needleman, “Starting Fresh with an Unpaid Internship,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, July 16, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203577304574280201046918712.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203577304574280201046918712.html</a> (accessed September 11, 2009).</span> So you might think twice about holding out for a paid internship. Before you make a decision about a paid versus an unpaid internship, put your internship consideration to the test. The right internship, paid or unpaid, allows you the opportunity to get experience, a chance to network, and the opportunity to test drive a job to see if it’s something you like to do.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_080">Rich DeMatteo, “3 Reasons to Take an Unpaid Internship,” Corn on the Job Blog, July 23, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://cornonthejob.com/2009/07/23/3-reasons-to-take-an-unpaid-internship">http://cornonthejob.com/2009/07/23/3-reasons-to-take-an-unpaid-internship</a> (accessed September 11, 2009).</span> Those three things can be well worth temporarily foregoing a paycheck.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s01_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Credit versus noncredit</strong>. In many cases, you may be able to earn credit hours for your internship. Begin by visiting your faculty advisor and learn about the requirements to earn credit for internships. Internships usually require a faculty mentor or other university liaison. Besides working the specified number of hours each week, students are usually required to write a paper. In addition, an employer evaluation is usually included in the grade. It’s best to understand the requirements for credit long before the internship is finished so that you can be sure that all the details are in order between your employer and the school. Be sure to fill out all the appropriate paperwork before the beginning of the internship. Just a note, although the internship does not usually require a textbook or classroom learning, most schools include the standard course fee for a credit internship.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s01_s01_p04">It doesn’t matter if your internship is paid or unpaid, for credit or noncredit, the payoff can be significant. Internships are like an extended job interview; the company gets to know you and your work, which could result in a full-time job offer after graduation. “Internships are so powerful,” affirms Wendy Washington, a senior vice president at Universal Records, whose assistant is a former intern for the company. “We get our employees from our intern pool. They know the system. They know how things work, and you can’t get a better character reference. Interns who work for our company have a better shot of becoming employed here than someone who just sends in an application.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_081">“Getting the Big Break with the Right Internship: You Can Beat the Odds and Become a Success in the Entertainment Industry,” TheFreeLibrary.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Getting+the+big+break:+with+the+right+internship,+you+can+beat+the...-a094672526">http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Getting+the+big+break:+with+the+right+internship,+you+can+beat+the...-a094672526</a> (accessed September 11, 2009).</span> That’s why it’s especially important to stand out in everything you do. And don’t forget to keep copies of the projects you work on; they are excellent examples of your work to include in your portfolio and serve as a demonstration of your on-the-job experience.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_082">“Make the Most of Your Internship,” WetFeet, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wetfeet.com/Undergrad/Internships/Articles/Make-the-Most-of-Your-Internship.aspx">http://www.wetfeet.com/Undergrad/Internships/Articles/Make-the-Most-of-Your-Internship.aspx</a> (accessed September 8, 2009).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Professional Organizations: Your Key to Growth</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_p01">You’re probably really pressed for time this semester. A full course load, your job, your community service work, family, friends—it seems like you can’t possibly fit in another thing to do. You already have twenty-eight hours for every twenty-four-hour day. Just when it seems like you can’t do another thing, there is one thing you should consider: it’s worth making time to join a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">professional organization</a><span class="glossdef">A nonprofit business group that is dedicated to supporting and improving the industry.</span></span> while you’re in school, then continue as a member after you graduate. It can build your experience and enhance your résumé.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_p02">There are most likely several professional organizations on your college campus. organizations such as the American Marketing Association, American Association of Advertising Agencies, American Society of Women Accountants, Sales &amp; Marketing Executives International are just a few that may have a chapter on your campus called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">collegiate chapter</a><span class="glossdef">An arm of a professional organization based on a college campus.</span></span>. If you’re not sure about what professional organizations are available on campus, you might consider visiting your campus student services center or career center. The people who work there will likely have information about the purpose of each group; date, time, and place of the next meeting; and more. In addition, many professional organizations may not have a collegiate chapter, but they offer <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">student membership</a><span class="glossdef">Reduced fees offered to students as an incentive to join the professional organization.</span></span> into their organization at reduced rates. It depends on the organization whether they offer a collegiate chapter or a student membership. Collegiate chapters are usually extensions of national organizations such as the American Marketing Association, and usually have student members on campus and hold regular events and activities on campus while leveraging and participating in national conferences, competitions, and best practices. Professional organizations that do not have a collegiate chapter but offer a student membership rate usually have events and activities with professionals in the local area but not on campus.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_p03">Being a member of a professional organization in school helps build your professional network, and hone your skills. It’s also a great résumé-builder because it signals to your prospective employer that you are willing to take the time to get involved in a business function during your spare time (of which you probably have none). Participation in a professional organization can help make you stand out as a candidate or help you meet the right people. In fact, some professional organizations, such as the Philly Ad Club, offer a formal mentoring program. This is an excellent way to meet an executive in the industry of your choice.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651621">Philly Ad Club, “Philly Ad Club Mentor Program,” May 5, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.phillyadclub.com/news_article.php?id=1973">http://www.phillyadclub.com/news_article.php?id=1973</a> (accessed September 12, 2009).</span> The networking aspects of professional organizations are well documented and are covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>. The reason for the existence of most professional organizations is to promote the health and advancement of the industry and bring people together for networking purposes. In addition, most professional organizations offer a newsletter that includes information about the industry and companies that can be very helpful for job leads and interviewing research.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651636">Sally Kearsley, “It Pays to Join a Professional Association,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jobscareers.com/articles/developingyourcareer.html">http://www.jobscareers.com/articles/developingyourcareer.html</a> (accessed September 12, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_p04">You might think that simply joining a professional organization is enough. However, what will help you stand out within the organization is to get involved. Keep in mind that all professional organizations are volunteer organizations, so it is easy to get onto one of the committees or even take on a leadership role of a committee. This allows you to demonstrate your skills, work ethic, and commitment to people who are usually more senior than you are (in the case of a campus professional organization, you stand out to your professors, which is a good strategy). It’s a great way to build your leadership, teamwork, and networking skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_p05">There are several professional organizations off campus that invite students to join, usually at a reduced rate. For example, the PRSA (Public Relations Society of America) costs $290 for an annual membership while the fee for a student in the PRSSA (Public Relations Student Society of America) is $50.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_086">Public Relation Society of America (PRSA), “Receive a Free PRSA Chapter Membership,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.prsa.org/membership/documents/PRSA%20Individual%20Membership%20Application%20with%20Chapter%20Pricing.pdf">http://www.prsa.org/membership/documents/PRSA%20Individual%20Membership%20Application%20with%20Chapter%20Pricing.pdf</a> (accessed September 12, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_087">Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA), “Join PRSSA,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.prssa.org/about/join.aspx">http://www.prssa.org/about/join.aspx</a> (accessed September 12, 2009).</span> It’s a good idea to talk to your faculty advisor, as she will most likely know what local organizations have a student rate. These off-campus professional organizations are excellent for networking to find the right people to whom you should be speaking to get the job you want. Professional organizations will serve you well throughout your career. Even after you graduate, you will be a student of the business. Professional organizations provide a platform for ongoing learning about industry trends, case studies, and best practices. Successful people stay involved in one or more professional organizations even after they have established careers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_p06">There are professional organizations for virtually every profession and industry. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch14_s03_s02_t01">Table 14.3 "Professional Organizations"</a> includes a list that can help you see some of what’s available.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_p02">Now it’s time to put what you’ve learned into practice. The following are two roles that are involved in the same selling situation—one role is the customer, and the other is the salesperson. This will give you the opportunity to think about this selling situation from the point of view of both the customer and the salesperson.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_p03">Read each role carefully along with the discussion questions. Be prepared to play either of the roles in class using the concepts covered in this chapter. You may be asked to discuss the roles and do a role-play in groups or individually.</p>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_p05">You are a significant customer, one that all your liquor distributors want to have because you have a four-star brand name. All the sales reps want to add your hotel chain to their client list. That’s why you split the business between several reps. You feel like that provides your business the best service and keeps all the reps on their toes.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_p06">You like it when sales reps spend time talking with you and demonstrate that they care about the business. In fact, you are always impressed when one goes out of her way to personally deliver a case of something that didn’t get delivered on the truck (it seems like that happens often). When a rep doesn’t respond quickly to a delivery error, you take away some of the business from them.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_l03">
            <li>You believe that when sales reps spend more time at your account, they care more about your business. How do you tell the sales rep that you expect more face time?</li>
            <li>When something is missing on a delivery, you expect the sales rep to bring the missing part of the shipment to the hotel that day. Do you think that is unreasonable?</li>
            <li>You call the sales rep often to see if he will do special things for the hotel, including tastings and other events. You want the sales rep to host a sampling event for a convention next week. You realize it’s not very much advance notice, but you want to ask anyway. What will you say to the sales rep?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_p07"><em class="emphasis">Role: Liquor distributor sales rep</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_p08">You have a very small part of this luxury hotel’s business; you really want to get more because the hotel has the potential to be your largest customer. However, the food and beverage manager is very demanding, and it takes a lot of your time; in fact, too much time. It seems that a sales call always takes at least two hours. It also seems that you are regularly doing hand deliveries because the food and beverage manager forgets to order things and expects a delivery within a few hours of his call. This account has been a time management challenge. You have to determine if you can get a commitment for more of the hotel’s business and reduce the amount of time you spend servicing the account.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_l04">
            <li>Although this customer has the potential to give you more business, he hasn’t yet. He asks for a lot of your time with in-person meetings, personal follow-up on missed deliveries and short notice for special tastings and other events. Should you always say yes to his requests in hopes of getting more business?</li>
            <li>If the customer is always right, what is the best way to balance your time and get additional business to offset your time investment?</li>
            <li>You are extremely busy with another customer on the date that this customer has requested a sampling at his convention, and you have a personal commitment that night. What will you say to this customer about his request?</li>

        <h3 class="title">Test Your Power Knowledge Answers</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s04_l06">
            <li>Traveling with an experienced sales rep or sales manager to make sales calls.</li>
            <li>Being exposed to an employee orientation process or method for a new employee to learn about company practices, policies, and procedures.</li>
            <li>Poor planning, procrastination, and making tasks too big.</li>
            <li>Get organized, set goals, prioritize activities, create a schedule, delegate work to others, and maximize selling time.</li>
            <li>Commission is the income that is based on the percentage of sales (or gross profit) generated; a draw is an advance against future commissions or bonuses.</li>
            <li>$1,100,000 × 0.12 = $144,000.</li>
            <li>Yes. Compensation may include as many elements as the employer chooses to offer. Usually commissions and bonuses are higher than salary to provide incentive for salespeople to sell more.</li>
            <li>KPI stands for key performance indicator: a measure of productivity that relates to achieving goals. KPIs are used to measure progress against SMART goals and are often used to determine compensation and incentives for salespeople.</li>
            <li>Take pictures of your top ten customers and top ten prospects; tell your family how you are going to celebrate when you achieve your goal; invest at least fifteen minutes every day to read articles, books, or blogs about your industry or profession; and write yourself a check for the amount you want to earn and keep copies with you.</li>
            <li>Although failure is a part of selling (and of life), personal responsibility means acknowledging and accepting that you are accountable for your choices, learning from failures, and not making the same mistake again.</li>
            <li>Get a good night’s sleep, eat a healthy breakfast, exercise, get right into your day, start your day with an important task, smile, don’t worry about what you can’t control, and take time for yourself.</li>
            <li>An internship provides practical work experience and gives you insight about what you might want to do (or not want to do) after graduation. Also, it’s a great way to network. In addition, many internships result in full-time job offers.</li>
            <li>Professional organizations offer students and professionals unique opportunities to network and learn about trends and best practices in the industry; they also provide a chance to stand out and be noticed by getting involved in a committee.</li>
