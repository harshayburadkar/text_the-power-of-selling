            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">There’s nothing more off-putting in a sales approach than a salesperson misspelling or mispronouncing your name. If the salesperson can’t be bothered to learn something as basic as your name, it sends the message that he doesn’t care about you as a person, and it certainly gets the relationship off to a bad start. In e-mails, double check that the customer’s name isn’t misspelled or mistyped. For telephone or in-person approaches make sure you’ve figured out how to pronounce the prospect’s name during your preapproach research. Ask contacts who might know (a receptionist, for instance, or your referral source) if you are unsure. And if the prospect has a difficult name, and you can’t get a confirmation on pronunciation, avoid using his name in your opening lines.</p>

The only way you can do this is to listen. Ask questions and then let your customer do the talking. During in-person sales calls you should engage in active listening, which was discussed in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch05#fwk-125752-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Power of Effective Communication"</a>. Show the customer that you are really listening by adopting a listening posture: look the customer in the eye and lean forward or incline your head while she’s talking. In any sales approach you should restate the essential points your customer brings up, both to check for accuracy of understanding and to show that you are paying attention.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_029">Edward Delgaizo and Seleste Lunsford, <em class="emphasis">Secrets of Top Performing Salespeople</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003), 54.</span></p>

While people naturally want to talk, they feel most appreciated when someone else is listening. That’s when people open up and share their goals, wants, and needs. Salespeople are often known for their ability to talk, but it is listening that makes the best salespeople.</p>

That way, he can tell people about his product in under sixty seconds, and it’s a perfect way to start a conversation or phone call and helps to make a good first impression. In fact, everyone from a CEO to an entrepreneur has an elevator pitch about her company to tell potential investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Most listeners don’t have the time to hear all the details about a product or service in the first minutes of a conversation so the elevator pitch provides just enough information so the audience knows what he is talking about and wants to know more. In other words, “An elevator pitch is an overview of an idea, product, service, project, person, or other solution and is designed to just get a conversation started.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_031">Chris O’Leary, “Elevator Pitch 101,” January 27, 2009, Elevator Pitch Essentials, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html">http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Establishing rapport can be a challenging task when you make your approach by phone because you can’t read your customer’s body language or other visual cues, and she can’t read yours.

You might say something like “This is Shamika Lorenz from Selling Solutions, a firm that specializes in helping businesses reduce their selling costs, and I’m calling to let you know about an upcoming seminar for small business owners in your area.” Such directness also conveys honesty and lets your prospect know that you won’t waste his time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_033">Sharon Drew Morgan, “This is a Sales Call: How to Begin Prospecting Calls with Integrity,” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?This-is-a-Sales-Call:-How-to-Begin-Prospecting-Calls-with-Integrity&amp;amp;id=34073">http://ezinearticles.com/?This-is-a-Sales-Call:-How-to-Begin-Prospecting-Calls-with-Integrity&amp;amp;id=34073</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s03_p01">While an e-mail approach is less personal than an in-person or telephone approach, it might be your best method, depending on the type of sale in which you are engaging. For instance, Internet marketing coach Sean Mize says of his business, “I generate 2,000 subscribers via the Internet every single month, so to try to contact all those individuals by phone, unless I have a huge telemarketing room, would be absolutely impossible.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_041">Sean Mize, “What’s the Most Effective First Contact with a Prospect—Email or Phone?” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Whats-The-Most-Effective-First-Contact-With-A-Prospect---Email-Or-Phone?&amp;amp;id=1206246">http://ezinearticles.com/?Whats-The-Most-Effective- First-Contact-With-A-Prospect---Email-Or-Phone?&amp;amp;id=1206246</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span> Here are a few things to keep in mind.</p>

You also wouldn’t send the exact same communication to all your prospects. The bottom line is that you want the e-mail to be as personal as possible.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s03_s02_p01">Keep in mind that an e-mailed sales approach is still a first impression, even though the communication doesn’t involve any immediate contact. While the e-mail should be personal, it should be more formal than the personal e-mails you send to friends. You want to sound knowledgeable and credible, which means paying close attention to your word choice and style. Give the e-mail the same attention you would give to a business letter. This also means reading the e-mail several times before sending it to check for spelling and grammar mistakes, just as you would with any other business correspondence.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_043">Daegan Smith, “How to Contact Business Prospects,” ArticlesBase, April 28, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.articlesbase.com/communication-articles/how-to-contact-business-prospects-398144.html">http://www.articlesbase.com/communication-articles/how-to-contact-business-prospects-398144.html</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

If you continue to send your e-mails regularly, eventually the message will register on your prospect’s “radar screen.” Of course, you don’t want your e-mails to be an annoyance either, so consider including an “unsubscribe” option somewhere in the body of the message for the prospects who truly aren’t interested so that they can request to be removed from your e-mail list.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_046">Sean Mize, “What’s the Most Effective First Contact with a Prospect—Email or Phone?” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Whats-The-Most-Effective-First-Contact-With-A-Prospect---Email-Or-Phone?&amp;id=1206246">http://ezinearticles.com/?Whats-The-Most-Effective-First-Contact-With-A-Prospect---Email-Or-Phone?&amp;id=1206246</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_p03">For PJA Advertising &amp; Marketing, entry into the social networking world has transformed the way the company interacts with customers on every level. Phil Johnson, one of PJA’s senior managers, says, “Now our social media activities involve almost everyone who works here and touch almost every aspect of agency life.” Early on, the company’s vice president of business development used LinkedIn to connect with PJA’s prospects and current customers, and today PJA uses LinkedIn in combination with Twitter, Facebook, and links through YouTube and Flickr to approach new customers and direct potential prospects to the company’s Web site. The upshot? According to Johnson, it’s working. The benefit of using social networks to reach prospects is that you can have greater transparency, he says. PJA might contact a prospect via LinkedIn and direct him to a YouTube video, which might then include a link to the company’s Web page or Twitter account, so in the end the prospect gets a view of the agency from a number of sources. “Today, when we walk into a capability meeting, the people we’re talking to already have had a lot of exposure to our thinking and our personality,” says Johnson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_049">Phil Johnson, “Tweeting Your Way to New Prospects,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 6, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/smallagency/post?article_id=137730">http://adage.com/smallagency/post?article_id=137730</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s01_p01">According to marketing specialist Leslie Hamp, even something as simple as “I noticed we were on the Webinar together, and I’d like to add you as my friend,” will work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_050">Leslie Hamp, “5 Steps to Effective Business Social Networking,” Social Networking News, July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> The point is that you want to give your approach a personal touch. If you just go out and friend all your prospects without making the effort to engage with them, they might not accept your friend request in the first place, and even if they do accept, they may wonder who you are and how you found them. Or worse, they may soon forget about you altogether. You can think of the networking tool as a facilitator, something that gives you the opportunity to connect, but it is still up to you to do the work of socially interacting and leveraging your connections.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s02_p01">There are so many new and interesting social media programs available that it can be tempting to join multiple sites; but if you are a member of more than two or three social networks at one time, you will probably find your efforts spread too thin. You can get the most out of your social networking by focusing on regular contributions to the few networks of which you are a member, rather than by trying to maintain your profile and connections on a number of sites.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_051">Leslie Hamp, “5 Steps to Effective Business Social Networking,” Social Networking News, July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s03_p01">In social networking situations, just as in face-to-face interactions, you want to build a good rapport by earning the trust and respect of your customers and colleagues. This means considering ways you can participate in and contribute to the online community, rather than simply using the social networking sites to promote yourself or your product. As virtual office administrator Sue Canfield says, “Social networking needs to be about building relationships—not primarily about self-promotion.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_052">Sue Canfield, “Social Networking Can Work for Your Business,” Chief Virtual Officer, May 12, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://chiefvirtualofficer.com/blog/2009/05/12/social-networking-can-work-for-your-business/">http://chiefvirtualofficer.com/blog/2009/05/12/social-networking-can-work-for-your-business/</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> For instance, if you decide to start participating in a news-related social networking site like Digg.com (where people post links to and comments about news stories), start rating and commenting on other users’ postings before you begin bookmarking your content there.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_053">Sudarmaji Lamiran, “How to Quickly and Easily Leverage Social Media to Build a Big List,” Social Networking News, July 13, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s04_p01">As with e-mail approaches, pay attention to your language. Use a higher level of formality when you contact business prospects than you would use when you send social networking messages to your friends; avoid slang (like “u” for “you” or “btw” for “by the way”).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_054">Leslie Hamp, “5 Steps to Effective Business Social Networking,” Social Networking News, July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s05_p01">Even though a social-network approach looks different from an in-person or over-the-phone approach, the purpose is the same—establishing rapport, building trust, and helping your customer discover needs and opportunities—so avoid making your sales pitch during your initial contact. For instance, returning to the example of the Web site design specialist, assume you added ten of your fellow Webinar participants to your social network. Maybe your company has made a short YouTube video that offers advice on incorporating blogging capabilities into business Web sites, so you send a message and link to your ten new contacts: “I thought you might be interested in this video.” In the video’s description on YouTube, you can post a link to your company Web site or blog where you make a direct sales pitch. This way you are offering your prospects valuable information without coming across as pushy. If a prospect is interested in pursuing your services, he has the resources to follow up on his own.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_055">Leslie Hamp, “5 Steps to Effective Business Social Networking,” Social Networking News, July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

When John Koss, sales vice president and partial owner of Koss Corp., wants to approach buyers from his megaretail clients, he heads to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Koss Corp. sells headphones and audio equipment to stores around the country, including big names like Wal-Mart, Target, and Sears. Before heading to CES, Koss schedules appointments with some buyers and hopes that others—like Wal-Mart’s buyers, who refuse to make appointments—will stop by his booth. He makes a number of sales approaches at the trade show and then spends the next few months traveling to interested buyers’ corporate headquarters, where he gives his sales presentations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_056">Susan Greco, “Marketing: Selling the Superstores,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, July, 1995, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19950701/2331.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19950701/2331.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Koss’s strategy is an example of one typical B2B sales approach situation.</p>

Why make an in-person approach rather than placing a phone call? While visiting in person takes more time and effort, it’s more personal: it is often easier to build rapport with your customer during a face-to-face interaction. There are just a few things to keep in mind when making an in-person or telephone approach in B2B sales.</p>

When deciding how to balance small talk with business, it’s important to take your lead from your customer. In the example where Janeka Jones from iFx approaches a prospect, for instance, it wouldn’t be a good idea to make a lot of small talk during your approach because the customer let her know that he was short on time.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s06_p01">In B2C sales situations, there is sometimes a greater temptation to focus immediately on selling and to forget about rapport building. In most B2C situations the salesperson hasn’t invested time in researching the prospect, and he might figure that this is a one-time sale. However, relationship selling is as valuable in the retail environment as it is in the B2B sales environment. Salespeople who treat their customers as <em class="emphasis">people</em> before they treat them as sales prospects are the ones who get good customer referrals and repeat buyers. If you have a restaurant or a coffee shop where you’re a regular customer, you might already know how this principle works. Aren’t you more inclined to order coffee at a place where people greet you, know your name, and get your drink order right—even if another coffee shop opens up closer to your home or your office? Here are a few dos and don’ts when it comes to earning your customer’s trust and building rapport.</p>

Maybe the customer comes into your computer store looking for printer ink. Rather than leaving him to fend for himself, walk him to the aisle where you keep your printers (don’t just point him in the right direction). Once you take him to the aisle, ask if you can help him find the right ink type for his printer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s07_p01">You might be thinking at this point, “Fine. Now I know how to establish rapport, but how do I turn the call into a sale?” The transition from the approach into the sales presentation will vary, depending on the selling situation. In a B2B sale, your approach might lead to a face-to-face meeting, which might be an information-gathering session where you learn about the customer’s needs in greater detail, and you might not actually make your sales approach for several months. On the other hand, in some B2C sales, the salesperson might be able to launch into her presentation in less than a minute after meeting the customer. There is no formula that applies; the important thing is to understand the environment in which you are working. Sometimes it makes sense to move directly into a sales presentation, and sometimes it doesn’t. As salesman and CEO Pat Cavanaugh says, “You don’t have to shoot every time you have the ball.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_068">Susan Greco, “The Nonstop, 24-7 CEO Salesman,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, August 1, 2000, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20000801/19766.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20000801/19766.html</a> (accessed July 31, 2009).</span></p>

How are you doing today? What if I told you that you could save up to 50 percent on your next big purchase of L’Oreal products? Our company has been selling top name cosmetics at wholesale prices for the past thirty years. Some of our customers include big names like Bloomingdales, Macy’s, and Nordstrom.” Offer a critique of this salesperson’s approach based on the pointers you learned in this section.</li>
                <li>Assume that you are in sales for a major financial services company. Given the state of the economy and the challenges that baby boomers are facing with retirement, you have new opportunities. What method would you use to approach a fifty-year old prospect that just lost his job and is concerned about his family’s retirement nest egg and was referred to you by one of your customers? What would you say (or write) as part of your approach?</li>
