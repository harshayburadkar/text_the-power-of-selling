    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_p04">While there is no one magic formula that will make your presentation come to life, successful presentations generally have a number of elements in common. Thinking of your presentation in terms of the following five steps will help you to plan and execute it with greater ease and success. Before the presentation, it’s a good idea to ask your prospect how much time is allotted for your presentation. That will help you tailor your presentation appropriately, keeping in mind your prospect’s time. It’s also a good idea to start the meeting by setting expectations in terms of time: “Just as a time check, I’ll spend thirty minutes on the presentation and allow fifteen minutes for discussion. We’ll plan to wrap up by 11 o’clock.”</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Build Rapport</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p01">In relationship selling, building rapport with your prospect lays the foundation for a selling partnership that could continue for many years. Especially if the sales presentation will be your first in-person interaction with your prospect, put effort into making a good impression. Offer your prospect a firm handshake and start with some small talk to break the ice. This isn’t difficult; you can establish a connection with a complete stranger over something as simple as the weather or a recent sporting event. Experienced salespeople use observation to their advantage, learning about the customer by noticing the environment of the prospect’s office. Are their photographs or artwork displayed on the walls? What items does the customer keep on her desk? As Bruce Harris, account manager with UPS, says, “A person’s office is a reflection of who they are and serves as an insight into his/her personality.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_080">Bruce Harris, “The Eyes Have It,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em> 54, no. 3 (2009): 17</span> You can make a personal connection and break the ice by questioning your prospect about a family photograph or a trophy he keeps on display. However, make sure not to go overboard on the small talk. Remember that your prospect is busy and has a limited amount of time to meet with you. If you spend too long on chit chat, you will eat up some of the time you need to get through your call objectives. Build rapport and then get down to business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_081">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">SPIN Selling</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 144.</span> This is also a perfect time to confirm the time that is allocated to you for your presentation. Although you discussed it when you set up the appointment, it’s always a good idea to confirm since things change at the last minute. This will help you quickly make adjustments if need be.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p02">In group presentations, it is harder to leave room for small talk because if everyone starts talking, the meeting could lose its focus quickly—and in very large sales presentations, small talk is impossible. Geoffrey James suggests building “group rapport” by opening your presentation with a memorable remark: something challenging or amusing.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_082">Geoffrey James, “How to Give a Killer Sales Presentation,” BNET, May 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=2940">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=2940</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> You could also open with a brief anecdote that establishes a common connection: “When I dropped my son off at school this morning, he told me to make sure not to give a boring presentation today.…” A comment like this might get a chuckle out of your audience and will build a connection because others in the audience probably have children as well and may have had common experiences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p03">Leading your presentation off with situation questions is another way to break the ice and get people talking. In group settings, people are often uncomfortable sharing their opinions right away, but if you ask questions that call for factual observation, rather than opinion (How many departments in your organization would be affected by this decision? What is the average turnaround time once an issue goes to press?), people can answer without feeling threatened.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_083">Gary M. Grikscheit, Harold C. Cash, and Clifford E. Young, <em class="emphasis">The Handbook of Selling: Psychological, Managerial, and Marketing Dynamics</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley-Blackwell, 1993), 158.</span> Once you get people talking, you can lead into problem and implication questions that require your audience members to voice an opinion.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s01_p04">Recall from the last section that it’s always a good idea to recap the findings of your last meeting in the opening of your call. This is another way to build rapport, remind your customer of your previous discussion, ensure that everyone is on the same page, and transition into your business topic.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Make a General Benefit Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p01">Keep in mind that to effectively demonstrate capability, you should sell benefits—solutions that address your prospect’s specific needs—rather than features or advantages. If your sales call is a follow-up on a previous call, you can make a benefit statement early on that will address issues you discussed in your last meeting:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p02">In our previous discussion, you mentioned that you had a minimum ROI requirement of 20 percent per year, and you said that you would be interested in pursuing this sale further if we could propose a solution that would meet your requirements. I’ve created an ROI analysis here that shows how outsourcing your back office work through our firm will yield an annual ROI of 25 percent. Other businesses like yours have experienced these results with us and have been very satisfied with the transition. Here’s what we envision for your company. (Show a slide with a diagram or chart giving a visual representation of your prospect’s cost savings with this solution.) Is this something you would be interested in?</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p03">In this general benefit statement, the salesperson has</p>

            <li>recapped the findings of the previous conversation to provide context,</li>
            <li>explained the value in an <em class="emphasis">idea</em> that meets the customer’s needs, rather than trying to sell a service,</li>
            <li>helped the customer to see himself as part of the story,</li>
            <li>used a closed-ended question to lead into the rest of the presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p04"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Closed-ended questions</a><span class="glossdef">Questions that demand a yes or no response.</span></span>—questions that demand a yes or no response—can help to move your presentation forward, keep your customer involved throughout the presentation, and confirm your understanding. Closed-ended questions have a role during your sales presentation, as demonstrated above.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p05">However, closed-ended questions should be balanced with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">open-ended questions</a><span class="glossdef">Questions that will help you probe further into the problem your product can solve.</span></span> that will help you probe further into the problem your product can solve. For instance, you might ask, “What are some of your biggest frustrations with your current back office operations?” It is virtually impossible to learn more from your prospect if you don’t use open-ended questions. If you are interested in learning more and engaging your customer in your presentation, be ready with open-ended questions. For example, the situation, problem, implication, and need-payback questions in SPIN selling are all examples of open-ended questions. Open-ended questions start with “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” or “why.” <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_f01">Figure 10.7 "Examples of Closed-Ended and Open-Ended Questions"</a> provides examples of closed-ended and open-ended questions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s02_p06">Asking the right questions is one of the skills required to be a successful salesperson. This is where your ability to ask the right questions really comes into play. It is the open-ended questions that you ask during this portion of the presentation that set the tone for the rest of your presentation. But don’t stop here. Ask open-ended questions throughout your presentation to engage the prospect and continue to gain valuable information.</p>

    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Make a Specific Benefit Statement</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p01">Once you have investigated to uncover your prospect’s needs, deliver a specific benefit statement: one that demonstrates in detail how you are going to solve his unique problem. It’s impossible to deliver a specific benefit statement at the opening of your sales call because there is no way you can understand your prospect’s needs and expectations without listening to him first.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_084">Michael T. Bosworth, <em class="emphasis">Solution Selling: Creating Buyers in Difficult Selling Markets</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995), 101.</span> Sometimes, a prospect may ask you to solve a problem that sounds similar to one you just solved for another company or customer, but if you assume you already understand your prospect’s situation and treat her just like your old customer, you might lose the sale. Approach each new presentation as if it were your first.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p02">In B2B sales, the specific benefit statement is generally something you prepare before your presentation (recall the discussion of this from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch08#fwk-125752-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Preapproach: The Power of Preparation"</a>). However, before launching into specific benefits, you can investigate to make sure you understand and have all the necessary information: “So let me make sure I understand. What you’re saying is that a 5 percent reduction in process time will reduce your costs by 20 percent?” In any selling situation, the information you get from your prospect is usually just the tip of the iceberg, and you won’t get an idea of the pressures she is facing unless you can get her talking.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p03">After confirming that you and your prospect are on the same page, you can move forward with your presentation, adapting if you need to based on your prospect’s answers to the questions you asked. This is the part of your presentation where the solution really comes to life. Bring your customer into the story with videos, recordings, displays, or anything else that will allow him to experience the product for himself.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p09">When you demonstrate your product for the prospect, make sure to draw attention to the features, advantages, and benefits that make it a good solution for her particular situation. In the example above, when your prospect takes the car out on the road, you could turn on the climate control settings that allow her to adjust for a different climate zone in the front and back seats and explain that this way she and her family can stay comfortable on long car rides. If she has her kids along, you could turn on the rear DVD player for them. These sort of extra, customer-specific benefits help your customer to make a personal connection to the product and to see her story aligning with your solution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s03_p10">During this part of the presentation, make sure to ask open-ended questions that will help you learn more about the prospect’s needs and her perceptions about the product: “You said that you like to go on family camping trips; how well does your current vehicle meet your family’s needs on these trips? It sounds like your current vehicle gets poor gas mileage; how does this affect your frequency of use or the length of your road trips? How would the storage capacity of the RAV4 change the way you use your family vehicle? How important is the car’s sound system to you?” Not only will these questions help you to uncover your customer’s needs and expectations that are still below the surface, but they will also help you to anticipate potential objections as you transition to the next part of the selling process.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s04_p01">This is the reason you are here—to present your solution that will solve your prospect’s problem. Since you started your presentation by asking questions, your presentation is a perfect way to incorporate the things you just learned from your prospect and incorporate them into your presentation. Yes, this means you have to be quick on your feet. That’s another reason preparation is so important.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep your presentation pithy</strong>. A shorter presentation is better. It helps you get to the point more quickly and have more time for dialogue with your prospect.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_086">Kelley Robertson, “How to Create a Powerful Sales Presentation,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Start with a quick review of the prospect’s objectives</strong>. This is a good technique to confirm that you were listening to your prospect throughout the process so far and confirms that you are on the same page. This also provides the ideal platform on which to present your solution and why it will help your prospect reach his objectives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_087">Kevin Davis, “10 Tips for Winning Sales Presentations,” Business Know-How, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm">http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Get a reaction from your prospect throughout your presentation</strong>. Use a combination of open-ended and closed-ended questions to confirm that your prospect is in agreement with the information you are presenting and to gain new insights into how your product or service can help him. “This time savings in your production cycle can help you save at least 10 percent over your current processing. Would you like to see how this would work?” is an example of a closed-ended question that helps keep your prospect engaged. “How do you think your team would like to submit invoices like this?” is an example of an open-ended question that helps the prospect think about the product or service in use in his organization.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_088">Kevin Davis, “10 Tips for Winning Sales Presentations,” Business Know-How, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm">http://www.businessknowhow.com/marketing/winslspres.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use demonstrations whenever possible</strong>. Showing how a product or service will work is far more dramatic and memorable than simply talking about it. If it’s possible to demonstrate the product in person, do it. If not, have a demonstration video. Bring samples, mock-ups, or prototypes if the actual product is not yet available.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_089">Kelley Robertson, “How to Create a Powerful Sales Presentation,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/salesselling/a/presentationkr.htm</a> (accessed January 4, 2010).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Have fun</strong>. When your passion and enthusiasm come through, it makes a difference to your prospect.

This is where you obtain your customer’s commitment, either to buy or to move the sales process forward. Especially if you are expecting your prospect to make a purchase at the end of the sales call, it is a good idea to use a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trial closing</a><span class="glossdef">Technique to test a prospect’s buying readiness.</span></span> technique to test his buying readiness. How likely is he to make a commitment now? By testing the waters with a trial close (e.g., “On a scale of one to ten, how important would this opportunity be to you?”), you can ask your prospect for an opinion rather than asking him for a commitment, so there is less pressure for both of you.

In relationship selling there is no such thing as a standard proposal; the proposal should include the details of a customer-specific solution and should reflect the things your customer values most. Even in retail situations—like car buying—while you might have a basic template you use for your contracts, you will adapt and renegotiate the contract depending on your customer’s needs. The key is that the proposal, like your presentation, should be customized to the individual prospect.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s02_p01">Have you ever noticed that when you go into a high-end clothing boutique or a store that sells expensive jewelry and watches, the price tags are hidden? The thing you immediately see is the product itself, beautifully displayed. The goal is a psychological one: to get the buyer to make an emotional connection with the product before he considers the cost. As a buyer, if the cost were one of the first things you saw, you might never make that emotional connection with the product in the first place.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s02_p02">This is something to keep in mind in sales. Never present a proposal—or otherwise mention pricing—early on in the sales presentation, not until your prospect has fallen in love with your product. You want your prospect to pick out the color of the car before she asks about payment; if she picks out the color, she has already imagined herself owning the car, and you have probably made your sale.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s02_p03">Of course, in a situation like car sales, you generally present the proposal in the same day as you present the product. You discuss your prospect’s needs, show him the car, let him test drive it, and then tell him, “Let me go talk to my manager to see if we can work out the numbers.” The process is a relatively simple one. However, in complex B2B sales, your sales presentation will probably <em class="emphasis">end</em> with a request for a proposal, in which case you will agree to a future meeting when you can present your proposal to the customer. B2B proposals are generally more involved, and so they require careful planning and a greater investment of time. If your prospect says, “Just send us the proposal,” ask for a face-to-face meeting; you can always send them the proposal ahead of time, but following up with a meeting in-person will help you address objections, answer your prospect’s questions, and demonstrate your enthusiasm for the project.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s03_p01">Until you understand the areas in which your customer places the greatest value, it is impossible to come up with a proposal. For instance, say your organization offers advertising services, and you find out from your prospect that her company especially values competitive pricing on individual projects. You decide the best way to deliver value is to drop your pricing below the competitor’s lowest price and to make up for the lower cost in your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">retainer fee</a><span class="glossdef">Fixed fee that a customer will pay in advance to secure your services.</span></span>—the fixed fee that your customer will pay in advance to secure your services. This way you can deliver value in the area that is most important to your customer while still generating the profits you need to run your business. In the end, you want a situation where everyone wins—but it takes some work to uncover the key to making this happen.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s05_s07_s03_p02">Sometimes your customer’s area of greatest value is determined by business needs, and other times the issues are emotional. For instance, if you are selling a car to a customer that wants a good value on his trade-in, recognize that he might have an emotional connection to his old car (in his mind it has a high value), so offering a low trade-in price, even if it is combined with competitive financing options, might be enough to drive your customer away. In fact, your customer might actually be willing to pay <em class="emphasis">more</em> for his new car if you can give him a good price for his trade-in.</p>
