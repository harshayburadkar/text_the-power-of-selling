    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_p01">There’s more than one way to start a sales approach. The method you use will depend on the specific selling situation, the specific customer, and on <em class="emphasis">you</em>. If you want the approach to feel natural, the best way to do this is to be yourself. The following examples offer some approach options, but of course the specific approach you use will be a reflection of your style and may include a combination of these approaches.</p>

You ask questions, right? A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">question approach</a><span class="glossdef">Opening a sales call with questions that will engage your prospect in a dialogue.</span></span> is also an effective way to open a sales call because it shows the prospect that you are interested in listening to him, it begins a dialogue, and it helps you get the information you need to move the sale along.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_069">Charles D. Brennan, <em class="emphasis">Sales Questions That Close the Sale</em> (New York: AMACOM, 1994), 49.</span> As sales consultant Michel Neray points out, asking questions that reveal something of what you know about the target company can also help establish your credibility. Ask questions that lead, questions that confirm, and questions that will allow you to test your hypothesis about the challenges your customer might be facing. Then, listen to what your customer has to say.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_070">Michel Neray, “How to Establish Credibility,” MarketingProfs, February 15, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/5/neray3.asp?part=2">http://www.marketingprofs.com/5/neray3.asp?part=2</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

This is a question you should ask no matter what sales approach you are using. Once you establish permission, you could ask a closed question (one with a yes or no answer) like “Are you happy with your current copy machines?” but then you risk ending the conversation quickly if your prospect says “yes.” You could ask an open-ended question like “How well do your copiers work?” but this is broad question, and there’s a good chance that you will get a vague answer. Instead, it’s better to ask a leading question that demonstrates you know something about the problems your customer might be facing with her current products.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Survey Approach</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s05_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">survey approach</a><span class="glossdef">Opening a sales call with a survey or questionnaire to better determine customer needs and preferences.</span></span> is one that works best in sales that require a complex solution or in sales where the solution is often specifically tailored to customer needs, and the approach ranges in levels of formality depending on the selling situation. For instance, if you go to an upscale spa to have a facial, you might be given a brief, informal survey about your specific skin-care needs before you discuss service packages with the aesthetician. Or if you are in the market for a new home, the real estate agent will most likely ask you questions about your preferences and lifestyle before she even begins to show you listings: “How many bedrooms are you looking for?” “Which neighborhood do you want to live in?” “Is outdoor space important to you?” “How many cars do you have?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s05_p02">On the other hand, in B2B situations or in otherwise more complex B2C sales, the survey process might be more formalized. If you want to purchase an insurance plan, the agent may guide you through a detailed, computer-based survey to find out about your medical or driving history, your family members, your vehicles, or other details that are very specific to you as an individual customer. In another B2B situation (e.g., your firm needs to purchase an integrated software suite with diverse capabilities like timekeeping, payroll, and benefits), the salesperson might give you a detailed questionnaire that will identify your specific needs and ask you to complete it before scheduling a sales presentation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s05_p03">The survey approach has the advantage of being a nonthreatening way to establish your initial contact with the prospect, as you are only asking for information and not discussing services or costs. It allows you to gather information and create a sales presentation that will address the customer’s specific needs and be prepared with the appropriate information or ask other people in the company to attend the sales call. In addition, the survey helps your customer feel like she is receiving special treatment because you are using the information you gather to tailor-make a solution that matches her needs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_079">Gerald L.

The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">premium approach</a><span class="glossdef">Offering free products or samples to attract a customer and build goodwill at the opening of a sales call.</span></span>, in which you offer your prospects free product samples or other giveaway items, helps build enthusiasm about your brand or products, attracting customers who might not otherwise express interest. Once you’ve gotten your prospect’s attention with the giveaway, he will be more inclined to listen to a sales presentation or at least give you a moment of his time. The premium approach is common in retail situations such as cosmetics, wine retail, or specialty food stores where sampling a product can often influence a customer’s decision to buy. In other cases, like trade shows, sales representatives might give out inexpensive promotional items or samples as a way to initiate contact with prospects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s07_p02">For instance, if you were working at a booksellers’ convention, your publishing house might be giving away bookmarks or even free copies of a new best-selling novel.

Even if you prepare a script beforehand, you won’t follow it word for word; instead, you will modify it based on the feedback you get from the customer during your interaction. Real-world, adaptive selling rarely fits neatly into textbook models. Often, an experienced salesperson will shift fluidly from one type of sales approach to another. For instance, he might start off by offering a product demonstration and mentioning a customer benefit almost simultaneously:</p>

                <li>You work for a games and toys manufacturer, and you are preparing to meet with a prospect for whom you have been given a referral by one of your longtime customers. Your referral source has told you that the prospect, a buyer for Toys “R” Us, is very task oriented and time-driven and appreciates working with others who do things efficiently. Given this information, which approach (or combination of approaches) will you use in your sales approach?</li>
                <li>Write a script for a sales approach that combines the referral and question methods.
