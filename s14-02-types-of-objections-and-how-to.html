    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p01">Learning how to handle objections is key, especially when many of the same ones occur regularly. There are six strategies that can help you handle virtually any objection.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p11">1.<strong class="emphasis bold"> View the objection as a question</strong>. Many times salespeople hear an objection as a personal attack. Instead, an objection such as “Why are your prices so high?” should be considered a question. That allows a more positive conversation rather than a defensive one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_022">Pam Lontos, “10 Strategies for Dealing with Objections,” FrogPond, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12">http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p12">2.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Respond to the objection with a question</strong>. As in every step of the selling process, asking the right questions is critical, and handling objections is no exception. Questions, such as “Can you share you concerns in this area?” or “Is there another way to look at this to make it work for you?” are good ways to engage prospects in dialogue that will help you better solve their problems.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_023">Keith Rosen, “Respond to your Prospect’s Objections,” AllBusiness, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-active-listening/4019422-1.html">http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-active-listening/4019422-1.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p13">3.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Restate the objection before answering the objection</strong>. It’s a good idea to check for understanding and demonstrate that you are listening by restating your prospect’s objection. For example, “So what you’re saying is you’re concerned about the capacity during peak periods” is a good way not only to acknowledge the objection but also to give you time to formulate your response.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_024">Pam Lontos, “10 Strategies for Dealing with Objections,” FrogPond, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12">http://www.frogpond.com/articles.cfm?articleid=plontos12</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p14">4.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Take a pause before responding</strong>. Many times salespeople “oversell” when they are answering an objection. When a prospect raises an objection, stop, listen, and pause for a few seconds. This shows the prospect that you are legitimately listening to her objection, not just trying to sell.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_025">Felice Philip Verrecchia, “How to Identify and Overcome Objections,” Edward Lowe Peerspectives, August 11, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf">http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_p15">5.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Use testimonials and past experiences</strong>. Don’t avoid answering any part of an objection. In fact, objections are the perfect time to share testimonials. For example, “I have another customer who was concerned about the turnaround time. He found that not only were we able to deliver on time, we were slightly under budget.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_026">Felice Philip Verrecchia, “How to Identify and Overcome Objections,” Edward Lowe Peerspectives, August 11, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf">http://www.bankseta.org.za/downloads/faisII/benefits/objections.pdf</a> (accessed October 24, 2009).</span></p>

Comments such as “This isn’t as good as your competitor’s product” or “I don’t want to take that kind of risk” are a reflection of a concern about the performance of the product. For complex purchases, prospects may not fully understand all the functions of the product due to lack of familiarity. Listening is an important skill to use, especially when a prospect voices a product objection. It’s a good idea to handle product objections by describing warranties, using testimonials, getting the prospect engaged in a product demonstration, or presenting industry or third-party research to support your claims.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_030">Charles M.

Bob Ladner, founder and president of a market research firm in Florida, wanted to compete with the big players but couldn’t get any prospects to give him a chance. Finally, in the middle of a sales presentation when he was overcoming objection after objection, he asked the prospect, “What do you want? A guarantee?” While it’s almost impossible to offer a guarantee in the market research business, Ladner ultimately designed one that works. His successful firm now boasts major clients thanks to the guarantee. “The guarantee is a method of generating confidence,” says Ladner.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_031">Leslie M.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Price Objection</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p01">One of the most common objections is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">price objection</a><span class="glossdef">A concern voiced by the prospect about the perceived value of a product or service.</span></span>. It is important to ask probing questions to really understand the nature of this objection. Many prospects use the price objection as a negotiating ploy to determine how much flexibility there is in the pricing, while others use it as a way to object due to budget constraints. It’s best to always be prepared for the price objection. The bottom line on the price objection is that people buy when they see the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value</a><span class="glossdef">The worth that a product or service provides to a customer.</span></span>. Cost (or price) is what the customer actually pays for the product or service. Value is the benefit that the customer receives from the product or service. It is value that customers assign to a product or service that determines the price. For example, value is what dictates that a shack on the beach in Monterey, California, is worth more than a similar home in Omaha, Nebraska. Or in another example, value is what causes customers to pay more for an iPod than a comparable MP3 player. Customers perceive that the design and function of an iPod delivers more value, even at a higher price, than comparable products made by other manufacturers. This is the essence of value.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p02">“The customer is typically going to throw the price objection out there just out of habit, out of rote,” according to sales trainer Chuck Reeves. When salespeople really listen to customers, Reeves says that they actually hear customers saying, “I don’t see the value, and if you can convince me there is value, there is return, then I just might pay.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_033">Rick Weber, “How to Overcome the Price Objection,” Trailer/Body Builders, January 1, 2003, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://trailer-bodybuilders.com/mag/trucks_overcome_price_objection">http://trailer-bodybuilders.com/mag/trucks_overcome_price_objection</a> (accessed November 7, 2009).</span> Even when budgets are tight, companies make adjustments to purchase the products or services that they find compelling and can help them profitably grow their business. If you think about it, the same is probably true for your personal purchasing; when you want something bad enough, you are able to somehow find the money for it.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p03">Many salespeople believe that price is the barrier standing in the way of making a sale. That is, they think that cutting the price will help them get the sale. Many times salespeople are willing to cut the price or a product or service when a prospect objects because they feel that if the product or service is priced lower, they will get the sale. This situation is sometimes compounded if the salesperson rationalizes cutting the prices because she believes the margins are high enough, or even too high. This “sense of fairness” approach never recognizes the value that the product or service brings to the prospect. If simply reducing the price were the answer, selling would be easy—and probably wouldn’t require your skills and intuition.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p04">The truth is that price is not the driving factor in most purchasing decisions. More important, pricing shouldn’t be determined based on your product cost. To be successful, you need to understand more about the value your product or service is delivering to the customer. It’s the value that should determine the price, not product cost, or even prospect objections.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_034">Tom Reilly, “What Is a Fair Price?” Tom Reilly Training, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.tomreillytraining.com/CPO%20article%205.htm">http://www.tomreillytraining.com/CPO%20article%205.htm</a> (accessed November 11, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p05">So be prepared for the price objection. Preparation will make you look at the product or service through the eyes of the prospect and will help you establish the value. The price objection might be handled in the following way:</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p08">Timing is everything when it comes to objections. While a prospect may raise an objection at any time during the selling process, it’s best to keep the pricing discussion until the end of your sales presentation rather than discussing it early on. (In fact, the same is true about salary when you are on a job interview—always postpone the conversation about salary until an offer is made.) The reason for this is simple: it gives you the opportunity to talk about <em class="emphasis">value</em> rather than price.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s03_p09">Think about the process of buying a new car. First, you go into the showroom and talk to a salesperson, then you go for a test drive and really fall in love with the car—how it handles, the smooth ride, the sound system, the GPS system, the smell of the leather seats. While you probably looked at the sticker price before you got into the car, you don’t really start talking about price until after you determined that this car has what you want. At this point, the value has been established, which makes it easier for the salesperson to sell on value than to simply sell on price.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn11_035">Lance Baird, “Overcoming the Price Objection,” B2B Insights Blog, October 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.godfrey.com/blog/post/2009/10/01/276">http://www.godfrey.com/blog/post/2009/10/01/276</a> (accessed November 7, 2009).</span></p>

While some budget objections are true, when the prospect really doesn’t have the means to purchase the product or service, it’s important to avoid these types of objections with proper qualifying.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch11_s02_s01_s04_p02">Even if you do your homework before you begin the selling process, there is still a good chance that a prospect may present a money objection. In some cases, the prospect’s budget may not be large enough to accommodate the cost of your product or service. If this is true, you may determine that this is a prospect for the future when his business is large enough to afford your offering. However, it is worth probing to determine if the objection is price or budget related. Like the price objection, this objection is also related to value. When prospects can’t see the value for the price, they object by saying either the price is too high or they can’t afford it. The best way to handle it is to anticipate it and be prepared:</p>

                    <li>Assume you are a sales rep for an interactive advertising company. Your prospect is learning about how social networking works and has responded to your presentation with the following comment: “I’m not sure this is really for us.” What type of objection is this? How would you respond?</li>
                    <li>Imagine that you are a sales rep for a commercial landscaping company. You have just finished a presentation that includes a five-year landscaping plan for your client’s property. She responded by saying that she doesn’t think there’s enough money in the budget for the plan. What kind of objection is this? How would you respond to her?</li>
                    <li>Assume you just presented your ideas to help your prospect increase traffic to his store by adding a sign on the side of the building. The customer was polite and listened to the presentation but said that he’s not sure he really needs the additional sign since there is already one in front of the store. What type of objection is this? How would you respond?</li>
                    <li>Choose a type of car that you might like to own. Review the company’s Web site along with Edmonds.com to identify the elements that create value for the car. How does the value relate to the price?</li>
                    <li>Assume you work for the school you are attending and are responsible for selling sponsorships of campus events to local companies such as restaurants, gyms, and retail stores. If your prospects say the price is too high, how would you overcome this objection?</li>
                    <li>Visit a retail store that engages in personal selling. Assume you are a customer for the product and present an objection to the salesperson. Record how she responds to it. Is it an effective handling of your objection? If so, why? If not, what you would suggest to make it more effective?</li>
                    <li>Read the objection outlined in this article: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=5207&amp;tag=content;col1">http://blogs.bnet.com/salesmachine/?p=5207&amp;tag=content;col1</a>. Then, take the quiz to identify the correct answer.</li>
