    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p02">It’s this line from the classic 1996 movie <em class="emphasis">Jerry Maguire</em> that says it all about negotiating and closing the deal. In the movie, Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent who has second thoughts about the way business is conducted, and when he voices his concerns, he loses his job and all his clients except one. Maguire’s passionate plea to his sole client, NFL player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), has become a dramatic metaphor for negotiations and deal making ever since.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_001">Jean-Marc Rocher, “Plot Summary for Jerry Maguire,” IMDb, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/plotsummary">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116695/plotsummary</a> (accessed November 19, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p03">While the movie is fictional, Maguire’s character was based on real-life sports agent Leigh Steinberg, whose firm has negotiated and closed more than one hundred multimillion-dollar deals for high-profile clients in every professional sport. Steinberg’s philosophy on negotiations and closing deals is based on the fact that life is filled with negotiations and deals—from deciding where to eat to buying houses and cars—and each should be handled with “a clear focus and principled philosophy.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_002">Alan M. Webber, “How to Get Them to Show You the Money,” December 18, 2007, <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/showmoney.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/19/showmoney.html</a> (accessed November 19, 2009).</span> There’s nothing better than closing a big deal…the right way.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p04">Whether it’s a major professional sports deal, business deal, or a major purchase, it’s easy to visualize what the “desired state” is in any kind of deal. You can actually see the athlete in your team’s uniform, imagine two companies merging together as one, or see yourself in the car you want to buy. In fact, you negotiate every day. You negotiate with everyone from your roommate about how to arrange the furniture to your siblings about who will use the car. You might even negotiate with your professor about when you can hand in an assignment that is late.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_p05">The step in the selling process that moves the conversation to a sale (or the desired resolution) is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">close</a><span class="glossdef">Consummation of the sale when the prospect agrees to the purchase.</span></span>. Many people believe that the close takes place at the end of the selling process because that’s when the prospect agrees to buy the product or service. But nothing could be farther from the truth. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Closing</a><span class="glossdef">Bringing the sale to fruition or getting the sale.</span></span> the sale, or getting the order, starts at the beginning of the selling process, long before you even come in contact with the prospect.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s01_p01">“What it takes to win a championship is to have your preparation meet the opportunities, whether it’s out on the racetrack or behind the scenes,” according to NASCAR driver Kurt Busch.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_003">Joe Guertin, “When Did ‘Closing’ Become a Bad Word?” Agency Sales, March 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html">http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> This is true in sports and in selling. Winning in selling—delivering value to customers and to your company—requires good solid preparation and hard work. Sure, there are some sales that fall into your lap. Those are the ones that make it feel like selling is easy. But most sales don’t happen that way. In fact, in many industries closing the sale may take weeks, months, or even years.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Despite the term “close,” which implies the end, closing the sale starts with the first step in the selling process—qualifying. Sometimes salespeople want to fill their sales funnel (or pipeline) with lots of leads so they don’t take the time or ask the right questions when they are qualifying. While it’s true that you want to “go out and get as many <em class="emphasis">no</em>s as you can,” you’ll get a lot more <em class="emphasis">yes</em>es when you pitch to the right prospects.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_004">Joe Guertin, “When Did ‘Closing’ Become a Bad Word?” Agency Sales, March 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html">http://www.allbusiness.com/sales/1064380-1.html</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> In fact, the selling process is analogous to building a house; if the foundation is poured right, everything else will easily come together. The same is true in selling—prospecting is the foundation of the entire process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_005">Tim Connor, “The Myth of Closing Sales,” Roderick Martin, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://roderickmartin.com/the-myth-of-closing-sales">http://roderickmartin.com/the-myth-of-closing-sales</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s01_p03">Not only does closing start at the first point in the selling process, but it also is far from the end of the selling process. In fact, closing is a lot like graduation—it is actually the beginning, not the end. Just like graduation is not the end of your education but rather the beginning or commencement of the rest of your life, the closing in sales is the beginning of the relationship with the customer, not the end of the selling process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Closing Time</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p01">The close sounds like it might be a definitive part of the selling process. It’s actually not a single statement, question, or event. Rather, the close is an ongoing series of events that occurs throughout the selling process, according to Mary Delaney, vice president of sales for CareerBuilder.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_006">“Closing the Deal,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, May 17, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> Qualifying is the key; it’s virtually impossible to close a sale with the wrong prospect. But the preparation doesn’t stop there. The preapproach, approach, presentation, and overcoming objections all play a role in the closing the sale. According to author Ray Silverstein, the close is made in the first thirty seconds of the sales presentation. He says that’s when a customer has an emotional response to you and your product or service story. Silverstein points to research that was conducted by William Brooks and Thomas Travisano that concludes that people want to buy from people they like and trust.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_007">Ray Silverstein, “How to Close a Sale in the First 30 Seconds,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/leadership/leadershipcolumnistraysilverstein/article178590.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/management/leadership/leadershipcolumnistraysilverstein/article178590.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> If this sounds familiar, it should be. The concept of building a relationship based on first impressions was covered in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>. And understanding the difference between needs, which are rational, and wants, which are emotional, makes a difference in how your prospect perceives you and the message you are delivering.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p02">To demonstrate that the close takes place at virtually every point in the selling process, Daniel Sheridan from Extensis Group LLC, a sales training consultancy, says it best: “If you’re waiting for a proposal to close, it’s too late.” He goes on to say that the most important meeting is the first one because that’s when trust and rapport are established.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_008">Simona Covel, “Finding the Right People to Make the Sale,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 29, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121199448885726503.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121199448885726503.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p03">The close builds on everything that has already taken place throughout the selling process—rapport, trust, information sharing. It’s also important to know what the close is not. The close is <em class="emphasis">not</em> a high-pressure exchange between seller and buyer. It’s <em class="emphasis">not</em> a time when the salesperson resorts to trickery, manipulation, or other unsavory tactics just to get a sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_009">Geoffrey James, “Close More Sales: Train Your Sales Team,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 23, no. 8, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=6389">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=6389</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> While sales are the ultimate financial goal of the selling process, relationships, trust, and understanding a customer’s business and providing cost-effective solutions are driving factors behind making the sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_010">Ram Charan, “What Your Customer Isn’t Saying about Your Sales Pitch,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, May 29, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121182439378120865.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121182439378120865.html</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> The same principles that guide the rest of the selling process also guide the close.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s02_p04">If closing is not a specific event that happens during the selling process, you might be wondering how you effectively get the order. You learned about the trial close in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch10#fwk-125752-ch10">Chapter 10 "The Presentation: The Power of Solving Problems"</a>. The trial close can take place during any part of the selling process. The trial close gives you the opportunity to get specific feedback from the customer as it relates to her likelihood to make the purchase at any point during the process. While the trial close is most likely to come during the presentation, it could come even earlier in the process depending on the prospect and the product or service being purchased. A trial close asks for an opinion (“What is most important to you about this product or service?”), whereas a closing question asks for a decision (“Shall we complete the paperwork?”).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_011">D. Forbes Ley, “Trial Closing Questions Tell You When to Ask for a Decision,” The Bachman Company, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bachmanco.com/pretz/PDF/Trial%20Closing%20Questions.pdf">http://www.bachmanco.com/pretz/PDF/Trial%20Closing%20Questions.pdf</a> (accessed November 18, 2009).</span> The trial close gives you the opportunity to learn what the prospect is thinking and will give you some insight as to when to make the close. In some cases, the trial close may result in a close, but if it doesn’t, the prospect’s response provides valuable insight. The trial close should be done early and often throughout the selling process. Getting the prospect’s opinion at various points throughout the process helps you determine your path and how and when you should make your close.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_012">D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s03_p01">There is an old adage in selling that says, “Always Be Closing” (ABC). This means that a salesperson should never miss the opportunity to close a sale, no matter where it occurs in the selling process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_013">Michelle Nichols, “The Two-by-Four Closing Question,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, April 19, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2007/sb20070419_586407.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/apr2007/sb20070419_586407.htm</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> But in today’s collaborative environment, it’s better to approach closing more like “Always Be Opening” (ABO).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_014">Joe Takash, “Connect with the Buyer,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.joetakash.com/media-resource/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/independent-agent.pdf">http://www.joetakash.com/media-resource/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/independent-agent.pdf</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> In other words, the best strategy is to always be helping your customer identify and solve his problems, just like you do when you are opening the selling process. Focus on asking the right questions and learning about how you can suggest solutions (in some cases, the solution might not even be your product or service). When you deliver value to your prospect, they will look to you for advice and counsel. “You become much more than a salesperson, you become their marketing expert, a resource, an ally,” according to Mario Russo, general sales manager at radio station WBEN-FM in Philadelphia. “That’s when you are successful in selling.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_015">Mario Russo, Executive Panel in Marketing 2335—Public Relations and Publicity, Saint Joseph’s University, Philadelphia, PA, November 18, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s03_p02">It’s true that asking for the order is critical for success in selling. But if you close too soon, you might run the risk that the customer thinks that the process is over and mentally moves on to something else.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_016">Mark Hunter, “Close Too Quick and You Lose Profit,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, November 4, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/mark-hunter/sales-hunter/close-too-quick-and-you-lose-profit">http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/mark-hunter/sales-hunter/close-too-quick-and-you-lose-profit</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> That’s why it is a good idea to ask <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exploratory questions</a><span class="glossdef">Open-ended, nonthreatening questions that encourage your prospect to discuss their business needs.</span></span>: open-ended, nonthreatening questions that encourage your prospect to discuss her business needs. This helps supplement the information you gathered during the preapproach, enabling you to understand what the customer needs and how to meet those needs. For example, if you are selling accounting software, you might ask the following exploratory questions: “What are the top three activities that consume your people’s time daily?” “What is the ideal way you would like your people to spend their time?” “What are the types of activities that you think can be automated?”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_017">“Closing the Deal,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, May 17, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=368</a> (accessed November 17, 2009).</span> None of these is a hard-sell question. Rather, each question allows you to listen and gather information so that you can identify how you can help the prospect solve his problem.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s03_p03">While you always have your eye on the prize of closing a sale, the focus is to extend your relationship with your prospect beyond selling to servicing and being a business partner. That’s what ABO is all about. When you focus your selling efforts in this way, it makes it easier to sell additional products and services to existing customers because you are constantly learning about ways in which you and your company can add value.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s04_p01">When you focus on delivering value to your prospects and customers, you have earned the right to close or ask for the sale. It might seem obvious, but sometimes salespeople get caught up in the selling process and lose track of the fact that it is a buying process for the prospect. Sometimes, simple questions like “Will delivery on Tuesday work for you?” or “Should we start your service the week of the twenty-first?” help you and the customer focus on moving from the sales presentation to the delivery of the product or service. The specific closing questions will most likely differ based on the product or service you are selling. For example, in pharmaceutical sales, industry sales expert Jane Williams adds, “Never end a successful close without adding the proper patient dosing.” She says, “It is very important that your physician prescribe your product properly.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_018">“Closing Arguments,” Selling Power Pharmaceuticals eNewsletter, September 11, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=648">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=648</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s05_p01">It’s rare that a prospect will say, “I’m ready to close this deal.” That step in the process usually belongs to the salesperson to actively close the sale. The best way to know when to close is to listen and watch. There are verbal and nonverbal cues that prospects provide that help you understand when she is ready for you to close. Here are some of the signals that the prospect is ready to buy:</p>

You won’t be able to be successful closing every sale. After all, even professional baseball players only hit the ball three times out of every ten pitches to be considered above average. While hitting the ball 100 percent of the time would be considered unrealistic, every professional hitter takes batting practice to help increase his batting average. His batting coach gives him tips as to how to stand, swing, and ultimately increase his percentage of hitting the ball. The same can be done in closing.

In fact, it may take as long as six months to three years to close the sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_034">Steve Kayser, “Shooting the Donkey in the Complex Sales Process…Hollywood Style,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scottymiller.wordpress.com/category/tips-on-navigating-the-complex-sale">http://scottymiller.wordpress.com/category/tips-on-navigating-the-complex-sale</a> (accessed January 7, 2010).</span> The product or service commitment is usually a long-term commitment with a contract as long as three, five, or even ten years or longer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_p02">While the selling skills discussed throughout this book apply to complex sales, there are some differences. According to Jeff Thull, author of <em class="emphasis">Mastering the Complex Sale</em>, there are four phases to a complex sale.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Discover</strong>. As with any other sale, research about the prospect and his needs is critical to success. During the discover phase, you set the stage for the ongoing relationship or engagement. This stage includes your detailed research about the company and its current provider including several meetings and phone calls with the prospect. It is at this stage that the prospect determines whether the engagement has potential.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Diagnose</strong>. In a complex sale, the decision is likely to be centered on what should be changed, such as the location of a warehouse, and includes a collaborative effort between the salesperson and the customer to determine if the change is feasible and desirable. This stage also includes extensive financial analysis to determine the impact of the decision on the company. The role of the salesperson is to be a true business partner and help the prospect understand the trade-offs and benefits of making a major change in the operation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Design</strong>. Complex sales usually involve products and services that are customized for each customer. For example, an ad campaign, software, retail fixtures, or other major purchases are adapted, adjusted, or designed exclusively for that customer. At this stage, the sales rep works closely with key people in the customer’s organization to design the best solution to fit the customer’s needs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Deliver</strong>. If the first three phases are implemented correctly, this final stage should logically follow. At this point, the key people at the customer’s organization have been involved in the design and financial justification of the product or service so the presentation of the formal proposal should lead to acceptance. Then the efforts are focused on the delivery of the product or service and implementation. For products such as software and other major purchases, there may even be training, troubleshooting, and other transition issues that are handled by the salesperson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_035">“Winning Strategies to Succeed in Complex Sales,” Prime Resource Group, March 2010, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.masteringthecomplexsale.com/sales-training-book-press-release.htm">http://www.masteringthecomplexsale.com/sales-training-book-press-release.htm</a> (accessed January 7, 2010).</span>
</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s01_s08_p03">During each of these phases, it’s important to identify all the decision makers and their positions in the process. As with every stage in the selling process, this is about asking the right questions. “How will your organization go about making this decision?” and “Who else do I need to talk to?” are good questions to ask during the discover phase so that you can get input and feedback from all involved at the beginning of the process. Once you identify all the people involved in the decision-making process, you’ll want to identify the decision makers. Again, the right questions will help you focus your efforts appropriately. Knowing to whom the expense will be charged helps you identify the ultimate authority. The person who controls the budget is most likely different from the person who will be evaluating the technical aspects of the product or service. For example, while the chief information officer may make the budget decision, the systems implementation manager may be evaluating the technical aspects of the software. Finally, you want to identify the “power broker,” the person who will ultimately make the final decision. This is usually the person, a subject-matter expert, who is the right hand of the person who controls the budget.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_036">“Ten Keys to Winning Complex High Dollar Sales,” Best-Coaching-Training.org, May 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.best-coaching-training.org/2009/05/29/ten-keys-to-winning-complex-high-dollar-sales">http://www.best-coaching-training.org/2009/05/29/ten-keys-to-winning-complex-high-dollar-sales</a> (accessed January 7, 2010).</span> In other words, you want to identify with whom you will be negotiating and ultimately closing the sale.</p>

                <li>Assume you are selling coffee to a chain of restaurants. The buyer is very concerned about changing the brand of coffee that the restaurant uses because coffee is the last experience that the customer has with the restaurant and she doesn’t want to change anything about the current experience. You have sampled your coffee in a blind taste test with her and in several of her restaurants, and all who have tasted it have chosen it as the better-tasting coffee.
