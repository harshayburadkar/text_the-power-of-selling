    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_p01">You probably learned about table manners, thank-you notes, and other forms of etiquette when you were younger. The way you conduct yourself says a lot about who you are in life and, by extension, in business. Although many companies have a casual dress code, don’t be quick to assume that protocol and established practices aren’t important. It would be easy to misinterpret lack of formality as lack of professionalism. Manners matter in selling, now more than ever.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Etiquette Tips for Letters and Memos</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_p01">Despite the use of electronic devices in business, formal written communication such as letters, memos, proposals, reports, and presentations are still major methods of communication in selling. These more official methods of communication reflect factual statements that you are making on behalf of the company. Here are some tips for writing business communications:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Use company letterhead where appropriate. For example, letters are always written on letterhead, whether in hard copy or in an electronic format that can be sent via e-mail.</li>
                <li>Use the formal elements of a business letter shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 5.7 "Business Letter Format"</a>.</li>
                <li>For a company memo, use the company format. Most companies have a set format for hard copy and electronic memos. See an example of a company memo in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 5.8 "Company Memo Example"</a>.</li>
                <li>Spell-check and proofread your document carefully before you send it. Be sure it is complete and factually correct and does not include any grammar or spelling errors.</li>
                <li>Use CC to indicate the names of other people who should also receive a copy of the letter or memo. The term “CC” is short for “carbon copy,” which dates back to the days of typewriters when carbon paper was used to make multiple copies of a document. It can also mean “courtesy copy”: an additional copy provided to someone as a courtesy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_042">Mary Ellen Guffey, <em class="emphasis">Business Communication</em>, 6th ed.

</li>
                <li>Use BCC (blind carbon copy) to send copies to other people without having the primary recipient see it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_043">Mary Ellen Guffey, <em class="emphasis">Business Communication</em>, 6th ed.

                <li>Start with a clear introduction and let the reader know right away that the purpose of the note or e-mail is to thank him.</li>
                <li>Be specific about the situation, date, or other information surrounding the reason for the thank-you note.</li>
                <li>Make it personal and make it special by including your own sentiments. A generic message such as “thanks for a great job” really doesn’t fill the bill. Think about exactly what moved you to write the note and be sure your reader knows what she did that was special.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_058">Terence P.

        <h2 class="title editable block">High Tech, High Touch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_p01">The year was 1982, and the world was just beginning to realize the amazing potential of computer technology. John Naisbitt wrote a book called <em class="emphasis">Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives</em>, where he coined the term “high tech, high touch,” which he defined as the contradictory state in which people are driven by technology yet long for human interaction.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_060">John Naisbitt, <em class="emphasis">Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives</em> (New York: Grand Central Publishing, 1998).</span> He wrote about how the United States has been transformed from being comfortable with technology to being intoxicated with technology, a state he calls the “Technologically Intoxicated Zone” in his 1999 book, <em class="emphasis">High Tech/High Touch</em>. You probably can’t imagine living without your cell phone or personal digital assistant (PDA), iPod, computer, or other electronic devices. In fact, it’s likely you can’t even remember what communication was like before the Internet.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_p02">Technology, with all of its efficiency and benefits, cannot, however, become a substitute for old-fashioned human efforts. “Technology makes <em class="emphasis">tasks</em> easier, but it does not make our <em class="emphasis">lives</em> easier,” according to July Shapiro in a recent article in <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_061">July Shapiro, “A Digital Myth: Technology Doesn’t Make Life Easier,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, May 11, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/digitalnext/post?article_id=136533">http://adage.com/digitalnext/post?article_id=136533</a> (accessed May 12, 2009).</span> Shapiro’s observation is true, especially as it relates to business; sometimes, the crush of technology takes precedence over business etiquette. However, people have begun to rethink the lack of personal interaction and its corresponding etiquette in the workplace. Yes, “there’s even an app for that”; a firm named Etiquette Avenue has recently launched an iPod app for business etiquette. The fact is, technology isn’t personal and can’t behave in the right way at the right time with your customer or on an interview; that’s completely up to <em class="emphasis">you</em>.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_062">CommercialsKid, “iPhone 3g Commercial ‘There’s an App for That,’” video, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szrsfeyLzyg</a> (accessed July 16, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_063">“Good Advice in Bad Times: New Etiquette Avenue iPhone App Puts Professional Protocol at Fingertips,” <em class="emphasis">Business Wire</em>, June 29, 2009.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_p03">Now, we’re seeing a bit of a reverse movement: Technology is so pervasive in selling that salespeople are actually pushing back on their managers and asking them for more face time and less gadget time. One of the best opportunities for sales managers and their salespeople to discuss business problems and build relationships with one another has traditionally been during “windshield time,” which is the time in the car driving between sales calls. “Sales reps report that the intrusion of technology has stolen this valuable time from reps and their principals [bosses],” according to a recent article in <em class="emphasis">Agency Sales</em>, because as soon as they get into the car to drive to the next call, the sales manager pulls out his BlackBerry. “If there’s one thing I could tell my principals [bosses] when they come see me in the field is to ditch the electronic communications and pay attention to me and our customers,” said one salesperson quoted in the article.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_064">“Reestablishing the Inside Connection: Open Communication with Inside Sales Strengthens the Rep Bond,” <em class="emphasis">Agency Sales</em> 39, no. 5: 38.</span> It’s no surprise that there’s a need for business etiquette, especially as it relates to technology.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Being Connected versus Being Addicted</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p01">In a recent pitch to a potential client, a marketing executive in Manhattan thought it was strange that his potential customer was so engaged with his iPhone that he hardly looked up from it during the meeting. After ninety minutes, someone peeked over the customer’s shoulder and saw that he was playing a racing game on his iPhone. This was disappointing, but not shocking according to the marketing firm that was doing the presentation; they continued with their pitch because they wanted the business. Some are not as tolerant. Billionaire Tom Golisano, a power broker in New York politics, recently announced that he wants to have State Senate majority leader Malcolm A. Smith removed from office because Smith was focused on his BlackBerry during a budget meeting with him. Recently, in Dallas, Texas, a student lost his opportunity for an internship at a hedge fund when he checked his BlackBerry to check a fact during an interview and took an extra minute to check his text messages at the same time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_065">Alex Williams, “At Meetings, It’s Mind Your Blackberry or Mind Your Manners,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 22, 2009, A1.</span> It’s no surprise that BlackBerrys are also called “CrackBerrys.” According to Maggie Jackson, author of <em class="emphasis">Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age</em>, we are living in “an institutionalized culture of interruption, where our time and attention is being fragmented by a never-ending stream of phone calls, e-mails, instant messages, text messages, and tweets.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_066">Patrick Welsh, “Txting Away Ur Education,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, June 23, 2009, A11.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p02">The need to be connected should not overwhelm respect for colleagues and customers. Although texting has become a national pastime, especially among teenagers, it’s important to know the appropriate etiquette for the use of handheld electronic devices when conducting a sales call.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p03">First, it’s best to turn off your electronic devices <em class="emphasis">before</em> you enter every meeting. If you think you can’t live without checking your text messages, think about how you would feel if you went on a job interview and the person with whom you were meeting was checking his electronic device during your interview. Just because some people demonstrate bad behavior and check their electronic devices for messages during a meeting doesn’t make it appropriate. In fact, it will help you stand out as a good listener, and you will make your customer feel even more important when you focus exclusively on her, as shown in this video.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">Sometimes, however, the use of technology is entirely necessary to conduct business when personal interaction is impossible. It’s important that verbal communication that is not face-to-face is effective and professional. Because you don’t have the benefit of using or seeing the receiver’s nonverbal communication, the challenges for effective and appropriate communication are even greater.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s03_p01">Written communication has evolved to include multiple methods, all of which have appropriate places in selling. Notice the operative word here is <em class="emphasis">appropriate</em>. E-mail has become an accepted method of communication in most businesses, whereas text messages, instant messages, and social networks are commonplace for only some companies. That’s why etiquette is especially important when using any of these methods of communication, and you should take time to choose your method carefully. Letters, memos, proposals, and other written communication are considered formal, whether they are sent on paper or transmitted via e-mail. However, text messages, instant messages, and social networking are considered informal methods of communication and should be used only to communicate less formal information, such as a meeting time when schedules have been adjusted during a factory tour. Text and instant messages should never be used to communicate company policies, proposals, pricing, or other information that is important to conduct business with customers. It’s also worth noting that in all these methods your communication is permanent, so it’s a good idea to know the dos and don’ts of electronic communication.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s03_p02">Social media give customers a voice like never before. When companies listen to customers, they can turn a bad situation into a good one; but if they don’t respond, customers speak out. For example, a dissatisfied Virgin America passenger posted a tweet on Twitter during a flight to Boston, thanks to the Wi-Fi service onboard. Virgin America monitors Twitter so closely that by the time the plane landed, a ground team met the customer at the gate to be sure his needs were met, and he left the airline with the memory of extraordinary service.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_082">Gerhard Gschwandtner, “Wow Your Customers with Twitter in Real Time,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sellingpower.typepad.com/gg/2009/07/wow-your-customers-with-twitter-in-real-time-.html">http://sellingpower.typepad.com/gg/2009/07/wow-your-customers-with-twitter-in-real-time-.html</a> (accessed July 23, 2009).</span></p>

Only when it is used for business purposes. “You’re isolating yourself,” says Dale Chapman Webb, founder of The Protocol Centre in Coral Gables, Florida. “You are sending a message that my music is more important than the work at hand.” If you feel the need to listen to your iPod or use handheld gaming devices at work, sales may not be the right profession for you.</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s02_s02_s04_l01">
                    <li>Proper <strong class="emphasis bold">etiquette</strong> is a necessity in selling. There are etiquette guidelines for virtually every form of communication, including conversations, meetings, business cards, business meals, thank-you notes, e-mails, text messages, and even social networking.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Written communication</strong> should always include proper grammar and spelling. This applies to formal business communications such as letters and memos, as well as informal business communications such as e-mails and text messages.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Written communication</strong> such as letters, reports, and memos are considered formal methods of business communication; many formal communications are transmitted via e-mail. Text messages, instant messages, blogs, and social networks are considered informal communications and should only be used for informal communications such as confirming a meeting place when noise is an issue, such as on a factory floor.</li>
                    <li>It’s best to remember that most <strong class="emphasis bold">written communication</strong> is permanent, so take the time to craft it carefully.</li>
                    <li>Professionalism should prevail in all business meetings and communications, including meals. When you are at a restaurant, it’s is good idea to remember BMW: <strong class="emphasis bold">B</strong>read to the left, <strong class="emphasis bold">M</strong>eal in the middle, <strong class="emphasis bold">W</strong>ater goblet to the right. Use silverware starting with the utensils on the outside and work your way in throughout the meal.</li>
                    <li>You can add a personal touch to a business relationship by sending a thank-you note. Although it is acceptable to send a thank-you note via e-mail, it is recommended to send a personal handwritten note to reflect a sincere sentiment that really stands out.</li>
                    <li>It is never appropriate to use an electronic device such as a cell phone, BlackBerry, or iPhone while you are talking with someone else. Turn off your devices before you enter a meeting.</li>
                    <li>When talking on the phone, be courteous and use an appropriate volume in your voice. Never discuss confidential or personal topics on the phone when others might overhear.</li>

                    <li>Assume you work for a textile manufacturer. Draft a letter to invite your customer to tour your company’s factory next month. Choose a specific date, time, and location for your tour to be included in your letter. Who, if anyone, should be included as a CC? Why? Who, if anyone, should be included as a BCC? Why?</li>
                    <li>Create a voice mail message that you would leave on a customer’s voice mail if you were calling to set up a meeting to follow up from your first sales call. What information is essential to be included in the voice mail? What information should <em class="emphasis">not</em> be covered in the voice mail?</li>
                    <li>You are scheduled to meet your customer for an off-site training meeting. You just realized you are at the wrong meeting location, and you need to contact your customer and let her know that you are on your way to the right location. What is the best method to communicate with your customer? What would your message be?</li>
                    <li>You just learned about a delayed shipment date for your customer’s order. What is the best method to communicate this to your customer?</li>
                    <li>You are in a meeting with a customer, but you have a potential problem that is developing with a different customer. You are expecting a phone call about the second situation during your meeting with the other customer. How would you communicate this to the customer with whom you are meeting?</li>
