Today, it’s even more complex with business being conducted around the world and with varying communication methods. In this constant, high-speed business environment, communication blunders can cost you more than you might think. Did you ever hear the saying, “You only have one chance to make a good first impression”?

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a> you learned about the importance of relationships. In fact, it is almost impossible to be in sales without developing relationships inside your organization and with your customers. Your relationship skills build trust, allow you to be a true partner, and help solve your customer’s problems; both internal trust and external communication are essential keys to your ability to deliver on your promises. How are these qualities intrinsically related? The way in which you communicate can determine the level of trust that your colleagues or customers have in you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_005">Gail Fann Thomas, Roxanne Zoliln, and Jackie L. Harman, “The Central Role of Communication in Developing Trust and Its Effect on Employee Involvement,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communication</em> 46, no. 3 (July 2009): 287.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s01_p02">Just like relationships are the cornerstone of trust, communication is the foundation of relationships. But it’s difficult to establish and develop relationships; it takes work and a lot of clear communication. You might think that sounds simple, but consider this: Nearly 75 percent of communications that are received are interpreted incorrectly. At the same time, interestingly, many people consider themselves good communicators. The telling disconnect occurs because people tend to assume that they know what other people mean or people assume that others know what they mean. This is compounded by the fact that people tend to hear what they want to hear—that is, a person may interpret elements of a conversation in such a way that the taken meanings contribute to his already established beliefs. When you put these assumptions together, communication can easily become “miscommunication.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_006">Patricia M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Communication Model</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_p01">The standard model of communication has evolved based on two parties—the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sender</a><span class="glossdef">Person who originates a message or communication.</span></span> and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">receiver</a><span class="glossdef">Person who is the intended recipient of a message or communication.</span></span>—exchanging information or ideas. The model includes major processes and functions categorized as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">encoding</a><span class="glossdef">The process of converting a message to be sent to a receiver into a symbolic form such as letters, pictures, or language.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decoding</a><span class="glossdef">The process of converting an encoded message into meaning on the part of the receiver.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">response</a><span class="glossdef">An action taken by the receiver in response to a message.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">feedback</a><span class="glossdef">The method of providing information back to the sender in response the message.</span></span>. In addition, the model accounts for <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noise</a><span class="glossdef">Anything that can interfere with the communication of a message between sender and receiver.</span></span>, which symbolizes anything that might disrupt the sending or receiving of a message.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_007">George E. Belch and Michael A. Belch, <em class="emphasis">Advertising and Promotion: An Integrated Marketing Communications Perspective</em>, 8th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2009), 146.</span> The communication model is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_f01">Figure 5.1 "Traditional Communication Process"</a>.</p>

Solomon, Greg W. Marshall, and Elnora W. Stewart, <em class="emphasis">Marketing: Real People, Real Choices</em>, 5th ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 378.</span></p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_p02">The model helps describe exactly how communication takes place. For example, if you send a text message to your friend to ask him if he wants to go a movie, you are the source, or sender, of the message. You translated or encoded your message into text characters. A personal digital assistant (PDA) such as a BlackBerry, iPhone, or cell phone is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">channel</a><span class="glossdef">The method by which a message is communicated.</span></span>, or the method by which you communicated your message. Chances are, if your friend does not have his PDA or cell phone with him, your message will not reach him, and you might miss the movie. So in this example, the PDA or cell phone is the channel. When your friend, the receiver, reads the message, he decodes it or determines what you meant to communicate, and then he responds. If he was talking to another friend while he was reading your text message and didn’t see the time the movie started, that conversation would be considered noise because it would be interfering with the communication of your message. Noise interferes with communication or causes distraction, whether it is heard or seen. When your friend responds to you by saying that he wants to go see the movie, he is providing feedback (or a response to your message). <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_f02">Figure 5.2 "Communication Process Example"</a> shows this example applied to the communication model.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_p03">The same thing can happen in a selling situation. For example, if you call a prospect to set up a meeting, you are the sender. The message is the meeting information (e.g., date, time, and place) that you encode into words. The channel is the telephone, and the receiver is the prospect. It sounds easy enough. Assume, however, that the prospect responds to you and agrees to the meeting. But because he was checking his e-mails while he was talking to you (which is noise), he puts the wrong time on his calendar. When you come for the appointment, he’s out of the office, and your sales call doesn’t take place. Now you have to start the communication process all over again. This is only an example of simply setting up a meeting. Now imagine the challenges if you started explaining the features and benefits of a complex product or negotiating a contract. You can see why understanding the communication process is so important in selling.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p01">One of the key elements of being a good communicator is having empathy. That means thinking about your communication from the receiver’s point of view. It’s focusing on what <em class="emphasis">she</em> wants to learn as a result of your communication, not what you want to tell her. Empathy is about demonstrating that you care about the other person’s situation. Think about when you received your acceptance letter from your college; the letter probably mentioned what an exciting time it is in your life. The author of the letter demonstrated empathy because she focused on the situation from your perspective. A purely factual letter, without empathy, might have said that you were accepted and that now the school can make their budget since they met their enrollment goal. That would be quite a different letter and would make you feel very different (and probably not very welcome). Although it’s always best to be candid, you should deliver information from the receiver’s point of view and address her concerns.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_010">Steve Adubato, “Empathy Is Essential to Effective Communication,” NJBiz, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.stand-deliver.com/njbiz/2008/020408.pdf">http://www.stand-deliver.com/njbiz/2008/020408.pdf</a> (accessed July 14, 2009).</span></p>

(Keep in mind that when you are in sales, you <em class="emphasis">are</em> the brand to the customer.) It is especially important to have an emotional connection and empathy when apologizing to customers. Chances are the customer is already angry, or at least disappointed, when you are not able to deliver as expected. You can express empathy in your communications by saying or writing, “You have every right to be upset. I understand how you must feel. I apologize for the late delivery. Let’s work on a new process that will help prevent it from happening again.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_011">Mary Ellen Guffey, <em class="emphasis">Business Communication</em>, 6th ed.

Sometimes, people are trying to avoid “bad news” or trying to avoid taking a stand on a topic. It’s always best to avoid confusion and clearly say what you mean by framing your message in a way that is easily understood by all receivers. It’s also a good idea to avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">buzz words (or jargon)</a><span class="glossdef">Words, phrases, or acronyms that are used only in a company.</span></span>—those words, phrases, or acronyms that are used only in your company.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s05_p01">If you go to dinner at Cheesecake Factory and there is a wait to get a table, the hostess will hand you a portable pager and tell you that the wait will be twenty to twenty-five minutes. Perfect. You have just enough time to run a quick errand at a nearby store at the mall and be back in time to get your table. If, on the other hand, she told you that you will be seated shortly, you might have an expectation of being seated in five to ten minutes. Meanwhile, “shortly” might mean twenty to twenty-five minutes for her. You would probably forgo running your errand because you think you are going to be seated soon but end up waiting for twenty-five minutes and being frustrated. Being specific in your communication not only gives clarity to your message but also helps set your customer’s expectations. In other words, your customer won’t expect something you can’t deliver if you are clear about what exactly you <em class="emphasis">can</em> deliver and when. The same is true for prices. For example, if you order from the menu at the Cheesecake Factory, you know precisely what you will get to eat and how much it will cost. However, if there is a menu special that you heard about tableside, but weren’t told how much the dish was, you might be surprised (and disappointed) when you receive the check. Specificity avoids surprises and sets expectations.

                <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s06_p01">Timing is everything in life and most certainly in selling. It’s best to be proactive with communication, and if you owe someone a response, do it sooner rather than later. If you are slow to respond to questions and communication, it will be difficult to develop trust, as prolonged responses may seem to imply that you are taking action without informing the customer what it is you are doing. Timing is especially important when you are communicating a negative response or bad news. Don’t put it off; do it as soon as possible and give your customer the benefit of complete information.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Listen Up</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p01">While you may think you are ready to communicate, it’s a good idea to stop and listen first. Creating your message is only half of communication; listening is the other half. But it’s difficult to listen because we listen faster than we speak—that is, based on what the other person is saying, we are already constructing responses in our minds before they have even finished. As a result, many people are guilty of “listening too fast.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_014">Jeffrey J. Denning, “How to Improve Your Listening Skills, Avoid Mix-ups,” <em class="emphasis">Ophthalmology Times</em> 26, no. 10 (May 15, 2001): 28.</span> Cicero once said that it is good thing that humans were given one mouth and two ears, in light of the way we use them.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_015">Patricia M. Buhler, “Managing in the New Millennium: Six Tips to More Effective Communication,” <em class="emphasis">Supervision</em> 70, no. 7 (July 2009): 19.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s02_p02">Listening, in fact, is so important that companies like Starbucks believe that it may directly improve profits. According to Alan Gulick, a Starbucks Corporation spokesperson, if every Starbucks employee misheard one $10 order each day, it would cost the company one billion dollars in a year.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_016"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span> That’s why Starbucks has a process to teach their employees how to listen. Although listening may seem passive, it is actively linked to success: One study conducted in the insurance industry found that better listeners held higher positions and got promoted more than those who did not have developed listening skills.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_017">Beverly Davenport Sypher, Robert N. Bostrom, and Joy Hart Seibert, “Listening, Communication Abilities and Success at Work,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Communication</em> 26, no. 4 (Fall 1989): 293.</span> So it’s worth it to hone your listening skills <em class="emphasis">now</em> so that when you get into the business world you can be successful. Here are a few tips:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s02_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use active listening</strong>. Confirm that you heard the sender correctly by saying something like, “Just to be sure I understand, we are going to move forward with twelve cases for your initial order, then revisit your inventory in five days.” Review the communication model above and take notice of the importance of decoding. If you decode a message from your customer incorrectly, the communication is ineffective and could even be costly. In the example above, the customer might have said in response, “I meant that the initial order should be five cases, and we’ll revisit the inventory in twelve days.” That’s a big difference.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask questions</strong>. Questions are a way to gather more information and learn about your customer and their business. They are also an excellent way to demonstrate that you are communicating by listening. You learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a> that asking the <em class="emphasis">right</em> questions is critical to being a successful salesperson. Focus on listening and asking the right questions, and you’ll be rewarded with great information.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Focus</strong>. Although multitasking has seemingly become a modern virtue, focus actually helps create more effective communication. Stop and focus on your customer when he is speaking. This is a sign of respect, and this concentration allows you to absorb more information. Take notes to remember exactly what you discussed. There’s nothing more important than what your customer has to say.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_018">Jeffrey J. Denning, “How to Improve Your Listening Skills, Avoid Mix-ups,” <em class="emphasis">Ophthalmology Times</em> 26, no. 10 (May 15, 2001): 28.</span>
</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Take notes</strong>. While it may seem like you will remember everything that is said at a meeting or during a conversation, taking notes signals that you are listening, and it provides you with an accurate record of what was said. “The palest ink is better than the best memory.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_019">“A Lesson on Listening,”Selling Power Pharmaceuticals eNewsletter, April 9, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=814">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=814</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_p01">It’s important to remember that you will be communicating with many different people about many different topics in selling. Sometimes, you will be communicating one-on-one and sometimes you will be communicating with a group. Just as people have varying social styles (as you’ve learned in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>), it’s important to know that people also absorb information differently. Research conducted in the 1970s indicates that people comprehend information in four distinct ways:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Why</strong>. They want to know the reasons for doing something.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What</strong>. They want to know the facts about it.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How</strong>. They want to know only the information they need to get it done.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What if</strong>. They want to know the consequences of doing it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_p02">This can be a helpful road map of the elements you will want to include in your communications, especially if you are communicating with a group, since you may not know everyone’s best method of absorbing information. It’s been proven that if people don’t receive the type of communication they prefer, they tend to tune out or reject the information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s03_p03">You’ve probably noticed that both people and brands communicate the same message multiple times and usually in multiple ways. Creative repetition is key to successful communication. Think about the advertising Pepsi ran when it launched its new logo in early 2009; you most likely saw the television commercial during the Super Bowl, noticed a billboard in a high-traffic area of a major city, received an e-mail, saw banner ads on the Internet, reviewed the commercial on YouTube, and saw the new logo on the packaging. Pepsi’s ad campaign illustrates the “three-times convincer” concept, which claims that 80 percent of people need to be exposed a message three times to buy into it, 15 percent need to be exposed to it five times, and 5 percent need to be exposed to it up to twenty-five times.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_022">Natalie Zmuda, “Pepsi, Coke Try to Outdo Each Other with Rays of Sunshine,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, January 19, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=133859">http://adage.com/abstract.php?article_id=133859</a> (accessed July 14, 2009).</span> You may have seen the message so many times that it’s hard to remember what the old logo even looked like.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_p01">It is important to use multiple types of communication so that repetition does not become boring like a broken record. There are three types of communication: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">verbal</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that involves speaking to one or many people.</span></span>, which involves speaking to one or many people to convey a message; <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonverbal</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that includes body language and other observations about people.</span></span>, which includes body language and other observations about people; and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">written</a><span class="glossdef">Communication that is done by way of printed words on paper or a screen.</span></span>, which includes a message that is read in hard copy, e-mail, text message, instant message, Facebook, Twitter, blog, or other Internet-based written communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_023"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span> Varying the usage of these mediums can help ensure your customer’s attention, but you must carefully develop each skill separately to communicate effectively.</p>
        <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Verbal Communication</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p01">An introduction, a presentation, a telephone conversation, a videoconference call: these are all examples of verbal communication because information is transmitted orally. Despite the ubiquitous use of technology in the business world, verbal communication is the most common method of exchanging information and ideas. Verbal communication is powerful, fast, and natural and includes voice inflections that help senders and receivers understand the message more clearly. The downside to verbal communication is that once it is spoken, the words are essentially gone; they are preserved only in the memory of those present, and sometimes the memories of the specific words spoken vary dramatically. The he-said-she-said argument is an example of this. No one really knows who said what unless the words are recorded. Recall is rarely exactly the same between two or more people.</p>

In fact, the same words can take on completely different meaning based on the inflection you use. For example, if you say the sentence in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_f01">Figure 5.4 "The Impact of Intonation"</a> with an inflection on a different word each time, the sentence communicates something completely different each time.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p06">Verbal communication may take place face-to-face, such as an in-person conversation or group meeting, speech, or presentation. It could also take place by phone in an individual conversation, a conference call, or even a voice mail. Other forms of verbal communication include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">videoconferences</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting that takes place in at least two remote locations and includes technology support to see and hear people in all locations simultaneously.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">podcasts</a><span class="glossdef">An audio broadcast transmitted via an MP3 player.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Webinars</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting that takes place on the Internet that allows participants in remote locations to view what is on the screen and hear the speaker and ask questions.</span></span>, which are increasingly common in business. All these methods allow you to use inflection to communicate effectively. Face-to-face meetings also provide the opportunity to use and interpret other visual cues to increase the effectiveness of your communication.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s01_p09">Verbal communication is especially important throughout the steps of the selling process. Your choice of words can make the difference in someone’s decision to first hear your sales presentation, and your presentation can determine whether that person will purchase your product or service. You will learn more specifically about how communication is used throughout the selling process covered in later chapters.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p01">Imagine that you are in a retail store buying a suit for an interview. When the salesperson approaches you, she smiles, makes eye contact, and shakes your hand. You respond positively. You notice that she is dressed professionally, so she makes you feel as if you will receive good fashion advice from her. When you make your choice, the tailor comes over wearing a tape measure around his neck. You know he is a professional and you can trust him to alter your new suit properly. On the other hand, if the salesperson waits on you only after you interrupt her personal phone call, doesn’t make eye contact or shake your hand, acts as if she is bored being at work, and is dressed in worn jeans and flip-flops, it’s unlikely that you trust her to help you choose your suit.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s02_p02">You have, no doubt, used and noticed nonverbal communication in virtually every personal encounter you have had. Think about it: A gesture, a smile, a nod, eye contact, what you are wearing, the fact that you are frequently checking your cell phone for text messages, and how close you stand to someone are all examples of nonverbal communication.</p>

In fact, some studies indicate that the influence from nonverbal communication such as tone and visuals can have a greater impact than the spoken words. Dr. Albert Mehrabian, a famed psychologist and professor emeritus of psychology at University of California, Los Angeles, is considered a pioneer in the area of body language and nonverbal communication.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Dress for success</strong> at all times, which means always dressing appropriately for the situation. The <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in this chapter covers how to dress for an interview. But it’s best to keep in mind that even after you get the job you want, it’s a good idea to dress a little better than the position. Even in very casual work environments, what you wear is a nonverbal communication about who you are. If you don’t dress for the next promotion, chances are you won’t be considered for it. Be aware of the company policy and dress code, and if in doubt, dress more conservatively. This podcast featuring Peter Post discusses how to handle casual dress in the workplace.</li>

Each of them is created over a period of time and can include collaboration from multiple people. Collaboration is especially important for communicating, planning, and creating documents so many people use tools such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wikis</a><span class="glossdef">A collaborative Web site that allows multiple people to share information, documents, videos, and pictures.</span></span> to share documents.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p04">Written communication is preferred to verbal communication when careful consideration is important or the information needs to be permanent, such as a company policy, sales presentation, or proposal. Written communication can also take place when verbal communication isn’t an option, like when you need to respond to an e-mail or text message at 1:00 a.m.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p05">Although verbal communication is faster and more natural than written communication, each has its pros and cons. Generally, written communication is better at conveying facts, while verbal communication is better at conveying feelings. Verbal communication has another significant drawback: consider the fact that humans listen much faster than they speak. For example, the average public speaker speaks at about 125 words per minute. Although this sounds natural, the average person can listen at 400 to 500 words per minute. That means that listeners’ minds have time and space to wander, which can impact the effectiveness of verbal communication.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_039"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span> (You may have noticed your mind wandering during a class lecture—even if you found the topic interesting.)</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_p06">Written communication requires a good command of the English language, including the rules of grammar and spelling. If you think that business exists solely on quick instant messages and text messages, you might be surprised to learn that they are only a portion of the communication within a company and between the company’s vendors and other partners. Because the nature of written communication is such that it allows time for consideration and composition, the standards for writing are much higher than for a casual conversation. Customers and colleagues alike expect clear, concise written communications with proper grammar and spelling. And because written communication is long lasting—whether on paper or on the Internet—errors or misstatements exist for an irritatingly long time. So whether you are writing a proposal, a presentation, a report, a meeting recap, or a follow-up e-mail, it’s best to take the time to think about your communication and craft it so that it is effective. Consider using the following tips:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be short and sweet</strong>. Shorter is always better when it comes to business correspondence. It’s best to include all pertinent facts with concise information. If you write your communication with the receiver in mind, it will be easier to make it shorter and more effective.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Grammar, please</strong>. Sentences should be structured correctly and use proper grammar, including a subject and a verb in each sentence. Business correspondence should always include uppercase and lowercase letters and correct punctuation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_040">Patricia M. Buhler, “Managing in the New Millennium: Six Tips to More Effective Communication,” <em class="emphasis">Supervision</em> 70, no. 7 (July 2009): 19.</span> If writing is not your strong suit, visit your campus student services office or learning center to provide information about upcoming writing clinics and access to other tools that can help improve your writing skills.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Check spelling</strong>. Use the spell-check tool on your computer. There is no excuse for a misspelled word. Text abbreviations are not acceptable in business correspondence.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Read before you send</strong>. Reread your document or electronic communication before it goes out. Is everything complete? Is it clear? Is it something you will be proud of days or weeks later? Take the extra time to review before you send. It’s difficult to revise a communication as revisions cause confusion.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Just the facts</strong>. Stick to the facts to maximize the impact of your written communications; leave the emotional topics for verbal dialogue. For example, send an e-mail to confirm meeting time, date, and location; use a verbal communication for the content of the meeting to be discussed, such as a negotiation.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s04_p01">Although verbal, nonverbal, and written communication all play a role in your communication with your customers, you might be wondering which one is best. It depends on your customer and on the situation. Some customers want to work day to day using all the latest technology tools, including text messaging, social networking, Web conferences, wikis, and more. Other customers prefer more traditional face-to-face meetings, phone calls, and some e-mail correspondence. Adapt to the method of communication that your customer prefers and not the other way around. In some situations, a face-to-face meeting is best—for instance, if you wish to discuss a complex issue, negotiate, or meet some additional members of the team. Sometimes, a face-to-face meeting isn’t feasible, so other verbal communication methods such as a videoconference, phone call, or conference call can be efficient and effective if used properly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s04_p02">Chances are you will use a combination of communication types with each customer tailored to his particular preferences and situation. Be guided by the fact that you want to keep your communication personal in meaning and professional in content. Think about it from the receiver’s point of view, and deliver bad news verbally whenever possible.</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s01_s04_s04_p03">It might seem intuitive, but it’s not always true that a face-to-face meeting is better than an e-mail. It depends on the type of relationship you have with the person. If you are competitive with her, it’s best to use e-mail to communicate. According to a study conducted by Robert B. Cialdini and Rosanna Guadagno in 2002, if you have a more cooperative relationship, a face-to-face meeting is probably a better choice if it’s physically possible.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_041">“Communicating Persuasively: Email or Face-to-Face,” PsyBlog, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/03/communicating-persuasively-email-or.php">http://www.spring.org.uk/2007/03/communicating-persuasively-email-or.php</a> (accessed July 15, 2009).</span></p>
