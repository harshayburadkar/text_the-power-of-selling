    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_p01">You have spending power, and lots of it. Millennials (or Gen Y, if you prefer) are estimated to have over $1.3 trillion in direct spending for apparel, food, music, entertainment, and other products and services. That number is understated due to the influence you have on parents and other older people who seek your tech-savvy advice on all types of products from computers to cars.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_001">Sarah Littman, “Welcome to the New Millenials,” <em class="emphasis">Response Magazine</em>, May 1, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.responsemagazine.com/response-magazine/welcome-new-millenials-1192">http://www.responsemagazine.com/response-magazine/welcome-new-millenials-1192</a> (accessed November 25, 2009).</span> You are one of the most sought-after consumer groups around. More sales and marketing efforts are aimed at you than at any other generation. You determine where and when you will spend your money. You have the power.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_p02">So what is it that makes you decide to choose Nintendo over Xbox, Mini Cooper over Chrysler, or Apple over Toshiba? Of course, the product has a lot to do with your choice. Price is certainly a consideration, but you don’t always buy the lowest-priced product or service. Think about it. It’s the ongoing relationship you have with the brand that makes a difference. It’s the fact that the company continues to serve up exactly the new products and services you need (how do they do that?). It’s how the company keeps in touch on Facebook and other ways that keeps you engaged in the conversation. And it’s the fact that you feel appreciated as a customer. When a company makes you feel like they forgot about <em class="emphasis">you</em>, it’s time to move on and spend your money elsewhere.</p>
    <div class="section" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Follow-Up?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s01_p01">Follow-up entails everything that takes place after the sale is closed from getting signatures on all contracts and paperwork to scheduling delivery. It also includes your ongoing relationship with your customer. Relationship is the key word here. If you were involved in transactional selling, only focused on making the short-term sale, you would not be worried about follow-up because someone else in your company would take care of it. You would move on to the next customer. In many retail selling environments, this may be the case. You would not expect to receive a thank-you note from the checker at the grocery store or the cashier at a fast-food restaurant. However, you would expect to hear from a real estate agent who sold you a new home, or from a financial services consultant who is managing your money.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s01_p02">It’s the attention to detail to be sure that your transaction goes smoothly that you rely on your salesperson to do. Think about how you feel when your salesperson adds value to your new investment with additional information and insights. That makes you feel like a valuable customer. Chances are, when you need something else (another house or more money to invest), the first person you will call will be the salesperson who continues to follow up with you. When one of your friends wants to buy a house or invest some money, you will be very likely to go out of your way to recommend your salesperson.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s01_p03">While the specific follow-up activities may vary from company to company and even customer to customer, <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s01_f01">Figure 13.1 "Areas That Require Follow-Up"</a> provides a summary of some of the most common follow-up actions that are expected. Many companies have a checklist or best practices that are used as guidelines to ensure that all details are covered. In the case of complex sales, follow-up may include a transition team with members from both the company and the customer. The transition team may work closely together, including weekly or in some cases daily status calls, to ensure that the transition to the new product or service goes smoothly. For example, the implementation of a new logistics system or software program may require that the old system runs parallel with the new system until all aspects are completely set up and appropriate training is conducted. This is especially true for products or services like these that have a direct impact on the operation of the customer’s business.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Follow Up?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s02_p01">No matter what product or service you are selling, the sales process can be challenging. The selling process starts with prospecting and qualifying (that was six chapters ago!). Depending on the complexity and buying cycle of the product or service, it could takes weeks, months, or even years until you close the sale. In fact, 81 percent of all sales happen on or after the fifth sales call, according to study conducted by the Association of Sales Executives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650886">David Frey, “Follow-up Marketing: How to Win More Sales with Less Effort,” Marketing Best Practices, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marketingbestpractices.com/Articles/FollowUpMarketing.htm">http://www.marketingbestpractices.com/Articles/FollowUpMarketing.htm</a> (accessed November 22, 2009).</span> It takes time, energy, and commitment to get to the point where the deal is done. Some salespeople spend all their time and effort to research the prospect, get the appointment, make the presentation, handle objections, and close the sale—and then expect to collect their commission check. They seem to literally disappear after the sale is completed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650901">Jeff Schmitt, “The Personal Touch: Make the Sale…after the Sale,” Sales &amp; Marketing Management, September 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale">http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s02_p02">Relationship selling doesn’t work that way. The relationship really begins with the close of the sale; follow-up is what makes a relationship grow and prosper. Follow-up is how most customers evaluate the performance of the product or service they just bought. As you may recall from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>, <em class="emphasis">you</em> are the brand to the customer. How you proactively handle follow-ups will make all the difference in your relationships and your sales. In other words, the best way to make the sale is by the way you handle things <em class="emphasis">after</em> the sale.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s02_p03">Here’s the not-so-subtle point here. Even though the sale is closed, you should never assume the sale is closed.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650970">Jeff Schmitt, “The Personal Touch: Make the Sale…after the Sale,” Sales &amp; Marketing Management, September 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale">http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span> This is especially important when there is a gap in time between the closing of the sale and the delivery of the product or service (as in the delivery of a major software package, installation of new equipment, or bringing on board a new product or service vendor). A customer can have second thoughts, sometimes called buyer’s remorse or cognitive dissonance (covered in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch06#fwk-125752-ch06">Chapter 6 "Why and How People Buy: The Power of Understanding the Customer"</a>). This is when a customer may think that the decision she made is not the right one. She may be in contact with a competitor, receive additional information, or be concerned that she made the wrong decision, paid too much, or didn’t consider some alternatives properly. You can help avoid letting your customers be vulnerable to alternatives.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650985">Jeff Schmitt, “The Personal Touch: Make the Sale…after the Sale,” Sales &amp; Marketing Management, September 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale">http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651000">Joan Leotta, “When Buyers Change, Grin and Sell It,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 21, no. 5, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5769">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5769</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> Increase your return on your time investment and your customer’s return on her financial investment and put your follow-up plan into place immediately.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Plan Your Follow-Up</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p01">Put together your follow-up plan even before you begin your prospecting efforts. While follow-up is the last step in the selling process, it is the step that can have the most impact on your customer. You worked hard to establish trust with your customer during the selling process. After the sale is the time to put that trust to work and continue to earn it every day. Lip service, saying that you’ll do something but not really putting in the effort to do it, doesn’t go very far in sales. And just going through the motions will put you farther behind. It may seem more exciting to be working on a new proposal rather than doing follow-up for a sale that has already closed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p02">Think about your follow-up plan with the following five elements in mind:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p20">1.<strong class="emphasis bold"> Demonstrate your personal commitment and connection to the customer</strong>. Start by saying thank you to your customer for her business. “Customers want to know you care about them, their business, their challenges, and them as individuals,” according to author and professional speaker George Hedley. “The number one reason customers stop doing business with a company is an attitude of indifference,” he says.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651031">George Hedley, “Customer Care = Cash,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em>, March 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hardhatpresentations.com/CustomerCareCash.htm">http://www.hardhatpresentations.com/CustomerCareCash.htm</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> How you follow up after the sale is a good indication of how you will respond throughout the relationship.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p03">Start off on the right foot by sending a thank-you letter. Everyone likes to feel appreciated, especially right after they have made a commitment to spend money. Your letter should be professional, yet personal, and sincere. This is the perfect opportunity to reinforce to the customer that she has made a wise decision; this is a perfect opportunity to reiterate the product or service benefits with a focus on the information you learned about the customer’s business during the selling process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_008">Dana Ray, “Phenomenal Follow-up,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 19, no. 6, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5081">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5081</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_009">Joan Leotta, “When Buyers Change, Grin and Sell It,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 21, no. 5, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5769">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5769</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p04">Besides demonstrating good business etiquette, a personal thank-you letter also serves some operational objectives. It should include your contact information, phone numbers, e-mail address, Web sites for customer contact (in addition to your contact information), receipt or order confirmation, and a list of next steps.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_010">Joan Leotta, “When Buyers Change, Grin and Sell It,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 21, no. 5, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5769">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=5769</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p05">Don’t just say thank you after you close the sale. Be ready to follow up with three to five “selling points” timed after the sale. For example, after a salesperson sells a car, she follows up with an article about a safety award that the brand was awarded. She also sends a birthday card to the customer with a note to indicate the value of the car has increased based on current market conditions.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_011">Sean McPheat, “Post Sales Follow Up,” Master of the Sales Force Blog, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mtdsalestraining.com/mtdblog/post-sales-follow-up.html">http://www.mtdsalestraining.com/mtdblog/post-sales-follow-up.html</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p06">Most of all show your customers that you appreciate them and their business regularly with a handwritten thank-you note, an unexpected visit, or small gift like a box of candy. Little gestures go a long way; they are like “one-a-day vitamins” for your business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651016">George Hedley, “Customer Care = Cash,” <em class="emphasis">American Salesman</em>, March 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hardhatpresentations.com/CustomerCareCash.htm">http://www.hardhatpresentations.com/CustomerCareCash.htm</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>

While you are the person on the front line with the customer, you have a team of people who are responsible for delivering the product or service as specified. “Don’t just check the box,” says executive coach and author Marshall Goldsmith.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651077">Marshall Goldsmith, “Don’t Just Check the Box,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, February 1, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/91/mgoldsmith.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/91/mgoldsmith.html</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span> Take the time to follow up internally to be sure all the i’s are dotted and t’s are crossed so that your customer’s delivery is flawless. That means taking the time to share details and insights about the customer’s business and preferences with your entire team (whether your team is large or small). When salespeople just fill out the forms to get things moving internally, there’s a high likelihood that some nuances can fall between the cracks. Keep in mind that your customer made the purchase because you can deliver consistently for her, but you can’t deliver the product or service alone. There are most likely internal processes for communication and delivery, contracts to be signed, schedules to be communicated, and other operational activities that require the entire team to be working in harmony. Follow the internal processes and go a step farther. Make your coworkers care as much about delivering consistently for the customer as you do; take the time to share information about the customer that goes above and beyond your internal forms. You’ll also be surprised to see that everyone involved will add value when each has a connection to the customer. And don’t forget to say thank you to your team. You couldn’t do it without them; share the positive feedback from your customer with the team.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651092">Jeff Schmitt, “The Personal Touch: Make the Sale…after the Sale,” Sales &amp; Marketing Management, September 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale">http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s03_p12">Adding value goes beyond the typical “I’m just checking in.” Every time you contact your customer, offer some insight, news, or expertise to help him and his business. Make yourself the trusted advisor and key collaborator. Provide insights from industry events, forward copies of relevant white papers, make introductions to subject matter experts in your company, and send company (or your own) newsletters. You can complement your personal follow-up with the Internet to provide valuable updates and networking connections through a blog, Twitter updates, LinkedIn discussions, and other social networking tools. All these types of communications help add value to your customer’s business so that when she has a problem (any problem), you deliver so much value that she calls you first to help her solve it. This is how you earn your seat at the table as a true business partner, not a salesperson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-651182">Jeff Schmitt, “The Personal Touch: Make the Sale…after the Sale,” Sales &amp; Marketing Management, September 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale">http://www.salesandmarketing.com/article/personal-touch-making-salex2026after-sale</a> (accessed November 23, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s04_p01">No matter how good you and your company are at taking care of customers, there will be a time when something doesn’t go as planned or as your customer expected. When you experience a setback, your mettle is put to the test. “Errors are inevitable, dissatisfied customers are not.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_029">Chia-Chi Chang, “When Service Fails: The Role of the Salesperson and the Customer,” <em class="emphasis">Psychology &amp; Marketing</em> 23, no. 3 (March 2006): 204.</span> It’s not about the fact that the problem occurred; it’s how you respond that matters. When a salesperson responds quickly to a service failure and delights the customer with the outcome, it is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">heroic recovery</a><span class="glossdef">Response to a service failure that delights the customer.</span></span>. The salesperson has the opportunity to perform a “heroic” action to save the customer’s business. For example, when a food service distributor sales rep personally delivers a case of ground beef that was missing from the truck earlier in the morning to a restaurant before lunch, he goes above and beyond to demonstrate service and help the customer avoid missed lunch sales.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s04_p02">In some cases, heroic recovery can improve a customer’s perception of the quality of service provided by a salesperson. Some customers actually rate companies higher when there has been a service failure and it has been corrected quickly than if there was no service failure at all. In addition, service failures can ultimately help identify service issues that are important to the customer. For example, an industrial packing company had an internal service standard of shipping 95 percent of all orders complete. This had a negative impact on the company’s ability to make deliveries within seventy-two hours, which is the industry average. After conducting focus groups, the company learned that customers valued complete shipments more than the seventy-two-hour delivery window. The company has since changed its policies and has created a competitive advantage based on service that is important to the customer.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn13_030">Gabriel R. Gonzalez, K. Douglas Hoffman, and Thomas N. Ingram, “Improving Relationship Selling Through Failure Analysis and Recovery Efforts: A Framework and Call to Action,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Personal Selling &amp; Sales Management</em> 25, no. 1 (Winter 2005): 58.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s04_p03">This is not to imply that a constant state of heroic recovery is acceptable to a customer. In fact, providing excellent service begins with understanding what the customer values and then having internal operations in place to be able to consistently deliver that level of service. Recall from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a> that consistency is one of the elements of a brand. If you as a salesperson, or your company, can consistently deliver on a service promise, then heroic recovery is not efficient or effective in servicing the customer or creating a loyal customer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch13_s01_s04_p04">Part of heroic recovery includes taking care of the customer—whatever it takes to make the impact of the service failure right for the customer. In addition, it includes internal analysis to identify where and why the service failure occurred, what it takes to correct the problem, and how to prevent it from happening again. As a salesperson, you want to be able to recover from a service failure with confidence so that you know the root cause of the problem has been fixed.</p>
