Although most commercial airlines have been working on policies and procedures to make pets more comfortable when traveling, and give their owners more peace of mind, husband-and-wife team Alysa Binder and Dan Wiesel just didn’t feel that options like Delta’s Pet First and Continental’s PetSafe really filled the bill. So on July 14, 2009, they launched Pet Airways, the first airline dedicated exclusively to transporting animals in a safe and comfortable environment. The airline includes nineteen turboprop Beech 1900 planes that have been converted to comfortably carry up to fifty live animal crates and one certified pet attendant. Pet “passengers” can fly one way for $149 and round trip for $250 to or from any of five major airport locations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_001">Dan Reed, “For Passengers of New Airline, When the Fur Flies, It’s in Style,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, June 19, 2009, B1.</span> Who else but entrepreneurs would conceive a business idea like this?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s01_s02_p04">Entrepreneurialism is critical not only for the growth of the economy in the United States but also globally. The Kauffman Foundation, in conjunction with researchers from Babson College and the London School of Business, found that the disparity in entrepreneurial activity in some countries is contributing to a gap in economic growth. “The Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) report provides conclusive evidence that promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing the entrepreneurial dynamic of a country should be an integral element of any government’s commitment to boosting economic well-being,” according to Paul Reynolds, GEM project coordinator at both Babson College and the London Business School.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_020">Small Business, “Entrepreneurs Add Vitality to the Economy,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html">http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html</a> (accessed September 19, 2009).</span> According to the study, Canada, Israel, and the United States are those countries that are experiencing the highest level of activity, while Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, and Japan have the lowest levels of activity. The GEM constructed a framework for countries to work within to encourage entrepreneurial activity that includes raising the participation level to those outside the core age group of twenty-five to forty-four and increasing the participation of women in the entrepreneurial process.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_021">Small Business, “Entrepreneurs Add Vitality to the Economy,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html">http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/vitality.html</a> (accessed September 19, 2009).</span></p>

In 2008, approximately 530,000 new businesses were created every month, which was a slight increase over 2007.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_024">Laura Petrecca, “Tough Times Drive Start-Ups,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, September 14, 2009, B2.</span></p>

Entrepreneurialism isn’t limited to a specific type of organization or business; it’s a state of mind, a way of thinking and behaving, a way of pushing for something better than the status quo. Entrepreneurs can be found in large multinational corporations as well as nonprofit organizations, and new business start-ups. Every large business or organization had to start small but think differently.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s01_s03_p03">Where does it all start? The entrepreneurial drive starts early for most who have it. Think about when you were young. If you were the one in the neighborhood who set up a lemonade stand, went door-to-door selling products, or set up a lawn-mowing service in the neighborhood (and hired your friends), you may have the makings of an entrepreneur. While you and many of your friends (and perhaps your siblings) participated in activities like this when you were young, not everyone will grow up to be an entrepreneur. A recent study, which focused on the behaviors of identical twins, has found evidence that entrepreneurialism may be based on genetics, not environment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_026">Nicos Nicolaou, Scott Shane, Lyn Cherkas, Janice Hunkin, and Tim D.

In fact, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data confirm that the number of nonemployer firms (those that have paid employees) is up 8.1 percent from 2007 to 2008.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_028">Laura Petrecca, “Tough Times Drive Start-Ups,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, September 14, 2009, B1.</span> These “accidental entrepreneurs” have come of age due to a variety of circumstances. Some, like Maureen Rothman, president of Rothman Associates, started her business when her employer went out of business. Although she had over fifteen years of selling and sales management experience, when people encouraged her to start her own business her first thought was, “I’m not an entrepreneur.” After developing a business plan and getting input and direction from resources such as SCORE, she said that everyone told her to “just do it.” “On 09.06.05 [September 6, 2005],” as she likes to say, “I did it!” and launched Rothman Associates, a manufacturers’ representative for hospitality seating products.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_029">Maureen Rothman, SCORE Open House, September 22, 2009, Valley Forge, PA.</span></p>

Ali Galgano recently traded in her high-powered job as corporate recruiter doing work for firms such as Goldman Sachs for her own jewelry company, Charm &amp; Chain. Brent Bouchez, David Page, and Nancy McNally gave up their glitzy, perk-filled jobs at an advertising agency on Madison Avenue in New York to start their own marketing firm named Five-0, which is focused on marketing to baby boomers. Kelly Elvin gave up a lucrative career as a lawyer to become a dog trainer. All have learned that life as an entrepreneur is very different from life in the corporate world. The thrill of running your own show and making your dream come alive is a learning process. There are no bosses, no corporate initiatives, no departmental deadlines, and no performance reviews. Everything is all you, all the time. Skills such as time management, understanding financial statements, building a good support system, and overcoming the isolation of working alone are all challenges in the entrepreneurial world. “Entrepreneurs have to be willing to listen and learn and make judgments and be adaptive,” according to Monica Doss, director of the Kauffman Foundation’s FastTrac entrepreneur training programs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_032">Laura Petrecca, “From Corporation to Start-up: Who Is Going to Fix the Printer?” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, September 21, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/startup/week2-corporation-to-startup.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/smallbusiness/startup/week2-corporation-to-startup.htm</a> (accessed September 21, 2009).</span> As for the issue of timing, some ideas might not work in the current economic environment.
