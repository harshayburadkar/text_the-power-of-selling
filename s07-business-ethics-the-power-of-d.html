The fact that you’re unlikely to get caught (and it isn’t impossible; people are arrested, prosecuted, and ordered to pay massive judgments for providing or downloading music illegally) may make you feel safer, but if you are caught, you could pay from $750 to $150,000 per song.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_001">Elianne Friend, “Woman Fined to Tune of $1.9 Million for Illegal Downloads,” <em class="emphasis">CNN.com</em>, June 18, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/18/minnesota.music.download.fine/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/06/18/minnesota.music.download.fine/index.html</a> (accessed February 13, 2010).</span> Other variables can further complicate the situation.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Ethics comes into play in the decisions you make every day. Have you ever received too much money back when you paid for something in a store, didn’t get charged for something you ordered at a restaurant, or called in sick to work when you just wanted a day off?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_005">College Confidential, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-institute-technology/427749-ethical-dilemma-question.html">http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/california-institute-technology/427749-ethical-dilemma-question.html</a> (accessed August 31, 2009).</span> Each of these is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethical dilemma</a><span class="glossdef">A situation in which options are presented which may be right or wrong.</span></span>. You make your decision about which path to take based on your personal ethics; your actions reflect your own moral beliefs and moral conduct.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_006">Manual Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, and Michael J. Meyer, “What Is Ethics?” Santa Clara University, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/whatisethics.html">http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/whatisethics.html</a> (accessed August 31, 2009).</span> Your ethics are developed as a result of your family, church, school, community, and other influences that help shape your personal beliefs—that which you believe to be right versus wrong.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_007">Manual Velasquez, Claire Andre, Thomas Shanks, and Michael J. Meyer, “Ethics and Virtue,” Santa Clara University, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/ethicsandvirtue.html">http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/decision/ethicsandvirtue.html</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span> A good starting point for your personal ethics is the golden rule: “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” That is, treat people the way that you would like to be treated. You would like people to be honest with you, so be honest with others.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p02">Your strong sense of personal ethics can help guide you in your decisions. You might be surprised to find yourself with an ethical dilemma about something that is second nature to you. For example, imagine that you’re taking a class (required for your major) that has an assignment of a twenty-page paper and you’ve been so busy with your classes, internship, and volunteer work that you really haven’t had the time to get started. You know you shouldn’t have waited so long and you’re really worried because the paper is due in only two days and you’ve never written a paper this long before. Now you have to decide what to do. You could knuckle down, go to the library, and visit the campus Writing Center, but you really don’t have the time to do all that and still write the entire twenty pages. You’ve heard about some people who have successfully bought papers from this one Web site. You’ve never done it before, but you are really desperate and out of time. “If I only do it this one time,” you think, “I’ll never do it again.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p03">But compromising your ethics even just once is a slippery slope. The idea is that one thing leads naturally to allowing another until you find yourself sliding rapidly downhill. Ethics is all about the art of navigating the slippery slope: you have to draw a line for yourself, decide what you will and won’t do—and then stick to it. If you don’t have a strong set of ethics, you have nothing to use as a guidepost when you are in a situation that challenges you morally. A highly developed set of personal ethics should guide your actions. The only way to develop a strong sense of ethics is to do what you believe in, to take actions consistent with your principles time and time again.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_p04">So if you buy the paper and get caught, you will not only fail the class, but you may also find yourself expelled from school. If you’re tempted to consider buying a paper, take a minute to read your school’s academic dishonesty policy, as it is most likely very clear about what is right and wrong in situations like this.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p03">You have no doubt heard the expression “Do the right thing.” It is the essence of ethics: choosing to do the right thing when you have a choice of actions. Being ethical means you will do the right thing regardless of whether there are possible consequences—you treat other people well and behave morally for its own sake, not because you are afraid of the possible consequences. Simply put, people do the right thing because it is the right thing to do. Thomas Jefferson summed up ethics in a letter he wrote to Peter Carr in 1785: “Whenever you are to do a thing, though it can never be known but to yourself, ask yourself how you would act were all the world looking at you, and act accordingly.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_012">Gerhard Gschwandtner, “Lies and Deception in Selling: How to Tell When Customers or Prospects Are Lying to You,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em> 15, no. 9, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=4256">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/article.php?a=4256</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s02_s01_p04">Ethical decisions are not always easy to make, depending on the situation. There are some gray areas depending on how you approach a certain situation. According to Sharon Keane, associate director of marketing at the University of Notre Dame, people have different approaches, so there may be multiple solutions to each ethical dilemma,<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_013">“An Education in Ethics,” Selling Power Sales Management eNewsletter, April 17, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=197">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/newsletter/issue.php?pc=197</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> and every situation may have multiple options. For example, if one of your best friends told you in confidence that he stole the questions to the final exam would you say nothing, use them, or report him? Certainly, using the questions would not be ethical, but your ethical dilemma doesn’t end there. Reporting him would be the right thing to do. But if you didn’t report him, would it be unethical? You might not consider that unethical, but what if you just didn’t say anything—is that still ethical? This is the gray area where your personal ethics come into play. Looking the other way doesn’t help him or you. While you might be concerned about jeopardizing your friendship, it would be a small price to pay compared with jeopardizing your personal ethics.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s03_s01_p01">While ethical behavior may seem as if it is the normal course of business, it’s unfortunate that some business people and some businesses do not operate ethically. Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, HealthSouth, and Lehman Brothers among other companies, have been highlighted in the news during the past several years due to unethical behavior that resulted in corporate scandals and, in some cases, the conviction of senior executives and collapse of some companies. While business has never been immune from unethical behavior, it was the fall of Enron in 2001 that brought unethical business behavior on the part of senior executives to the forefront. Enron began as a traditional energy company in 1985. But when energy markets were deregulated (prices were determined based on the competition rather than being set by the government) in 1996, Enron grew rapidly. The company began to expand to areas such as Internet services and borrowed money to fund the new businesses. The debt made the company look less profitable, so the senior management created partnerships in order to keep the debt off the books. In other words, they created “paper companies” that held the debt, and they showed a completely different set of financial statements to shareholders (owners of the company) and the government (U.S. Securities Exchange Commission [SEC]). This accounting made Enron look extremely profitable—it appeared to have tripled its profit in two years. As a result, more people bought stock in the company. This lack of disclosure is against the law, as publicly traded companies are required to disclose accurate financial statements to shareholders and the SEC. There began to be speculation about the accuracy of Enron’s accounting, and on October 16, 2001, the company announced a loss of $638 million. On October 22 of that year, the SEC announced that Enron was under investigation. The stock price continued to fall, and the company was unable to repay its commitments to its shareholders. As a result of this unethical and illegal behavior on the part of senior management, the company filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_016">NewsHour Extra, “What Happened to Enron?” Paul Solman, PBS, January 22, 2002, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june02/enron_past.html">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/extra/features/jan-june02/enron_past.html</a> (accessed December 6, 2009).</span> The unethical (and illegal) behavior of the senior management team caused a ripple effect that resulted in many innocent people losing their money and their jobs.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Ethical Dilemmas in Business</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s03_s02_p01">Not all behavior that is unethical is illegal. Companies frequently are faced with ethical dilemmas that are not necessarily illegal but are just as important to navigate. For example, if a travel company wants to attract a lot of new customers, it can honestly state the price of a trip to Disney World in its advertising and let customers decide if they want to purchase the trip. This would be ethical behavior. However, if the company advertises a free vacation in order to get customers to call, but the free vacation package includes a $500 booking fee, it is unethical. Or if an appliance store wants to get new customers by advertising a low-priced refrigerator, it is an ethical way to let customers know that the company has competitively priced appliances as well. However, if the store only has a higher-priced refrigerator in stock and tries to sell that one instead, it is unethical behavior.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s03_s02_p02">Sometimes ethical behavior can be a matter of disclosure, as in the case of Enron, Bernie Madoff, or the examples above. Business ethics can also be challenged based on business practices. For example, in the 1990s Nike was accused of exploiting workers in third-world countries to manufacture their products. The low wages they were paying the workers made Nike’s profits higher.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_021">Aaron Bernstein, “Nike’s New Game Plan for Sweatshops,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, September 20, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_38/b3900011_mz001.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_38/b3900011_mz001.htm</a> (accessed December 6, 2009).</span> While this is not illegal behavior—they were paying the workers—it was considered unethical because they were paying the workers less than what is reasonable. Another example of unethical behavior is not disclosing information. For example, if a car salesperson knows that a used car he is selling has been in an accident but says that it has not been involved in an accident, that is unethical. Bribing an executive, saying or promising things that are knowingly untrue, or treating employees unfairly are all examples of unethical behavior in business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s04_p01">You may choose to shop at companies because of their business practices. For example, you might like The Body Shop because of its commitment to selling products that do not use animals for testing. This is a case of ethical behavior that is socially responsible. In fact, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">corporate social responsibility (CSR)</a><span class="glossdef">Company actions that balance the interests of all stakeholders.</span></span> is when companies operate in a way that balances the interests of all stakeholders including employees, customers, investors, vendors, the community, society, and any other parties that have a stake in the company. While corporate social responsibility may seem easy, it’s not always as easy as it looks. Keep in mind that in order to be socially responsible a company has to balance the social, economic, and environmental dimensions, which means generating a profit for investors while serving the best interest of all parties that have a stake in the operations of the company. When companies measure the impact of their performance along the three dimensions of social, economic, and environmental impact, it is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">triple bottom line</a><span class="glossdef">Measurement of company performance along three dimensions—social, economic, and environmental.</span></span>.

It’s no surprise that companies that consistently demonstrate ethical behavior and social responsibility generate better results. In successful companies ethics is so integrated into the organization that it defines how every employee from CEO to the lowest-level employee behaves.

It is times like these that can challenge many companies that do not have this kind of ethical commitment. With pressure on short-term results, many companies set unrealistic goals and employees feel extreme pressure to meet them or face the possibility of losing their jobs. Professor Neil Malhotra of the Stanford Graduate School of Business calls this an “overemphasis on instant gratification.” In fact, he feels that is the root cause of the current economic crisis.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_024">Jeremy Dann, “Business Ethics integral to Corporate Strategy, Says Stanford’s Malhotra,” BNET, July 1, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.bnet.com/mba/?p=927&amp;tag=content;col1">http://blogs.bnet.com/mba/?p=927&amp;tag=content;col1</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span> But business ethics, just like personal ethics, mean doing the right thing even when it is a difficult choice or doesn’t appear to be advantageous.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s07_p01">Ethics and values are major concepts. If you have developed personal ethics and values, you might be wondering how they come together to help provide a roadmap for your life and your career. That’s the purpose of your mission statement; it becomes your roadmap for your decisions, choices, and behavior. You learned about creating your personal mission statement in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s07_p02">Just as your personal mission statement is a blueprint for how you make decisions in life, companies also use a mission statement to define their direction, make operating decisions, and communicate to employees, vendors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. In fact, most companies have a formal, written mission that they include on their Web site. A mission statement is different than an advertising slogan or motto. It is based on the company’s ethics and values and provides a broad direction as to what the company stands for. For example, Harley-Davidson’s mission statement is below and can be found on their Web site.</p>

Both had stellar reputations and were considered role models. Now both are working to gain back the trust of the public. Reputation isn’t limited to the wealthy or powerful. In high school, you knew that Sharon was a brain and Timothy was the sensitive, poetic type. You may never have had a conversation with either one of them, but you knew their reputations. Meanwhile, you avoided classes with Mrs. Avar because she had a reputation as a hard grader. Your reactions to many of the people in your day-to-day life are affected by their reputations.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s09_p03">A great way to build your reputation in a specific industry is to become an industry expert: write a blog, tweet regularly about industry issues, be a guest speaker or panelist at industry conferences or events online or in person. Decision makers hear and see you take on a leadership role and seek you out to gain your expertise. You can build your reputation, which, in turn, will help you build your client list.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_050">Renee Houston Zemanski, “The Power of Your Reputation,” <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP1900197">http://www.sellingpower.com/article/display.asp?aid=SP1900197</a> (accessed August 29, 2009).</span></p>

If you fail to follow up, forget details, or even if you are consistently late for meetings, you may become known as unreliable.

I would tell them, ‘Regardless of the circumstances, regardless of what the contract says, we always want you to do the right thing. Do you know what it means to do the right thing?’ I would ask.” Bailey knows that any action taken by a salesperson can affect his or her reputation: “If your actions are described on the front page of our local newspaper or <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, will most people read the account and say, ‘I think they did the right thing?” That’s the kind of action we encourage and expect.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_052">Robert L.

David Chittock, president of Incentra, Inc., discusses one encounter in which a customer shared her view of salespeople: “The prospect’s body language told me she wasn’t just uncomfortable—she was downright hostile to me. Finally, she shared this sentiment out loud: ‘I have to be honest with you. I think that all salespeople are liars, and I don’t trust any of them, and I don’t trust you.’” He goes on to explain that “many (if not all) of our prospects, view salespeople with suspicion, assuming that in attempting to make a sale, we will be self-serving, manipulative, and possibly even untruthful.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_053">David Chittock, “Outside the Box: A Question of Integrity,” Manage Smarter, May 28, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.presentations.com/msg/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003977677">http://www.presentations.com/msg/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003977677</a> (accessed February 18, 2010).</span> Chittock and his employees overcome that suspicion by making promises to their customers and then keeping them—sure, it sounds simple, but too many salespeople are willing to promise their customers the moon in order to close the deal.</p>

Figure out what you can realistically guarantee, make the promise, and then keep it. Jack Welch, in his book <em class="emphasis">Winning</em>, declares that “too many people—too often—instinctively don’t express themselves with frankness.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p01">Imagine that you are the buyer for Chez Food, a popular pan-European restaurant on the West Coast. You have good relationships with your suppliers, especially your produce guy, a genial fellow who owns his own business. As the holidays approach, Ray, your produce guy, approaches you with a gift. He tells you that he really appreciates both your business and your friendship, and he hands you two tickets to a Caribbean cruise. The company policy is clear: you aren’t supposed to accept gifts from suppliers, but, you argue to yourself, what could be the harm? After all, you were planning to keep buying from Ray before he offered you the tickets; it’s not as though he’s asking you for anything, anyway. What will you do? Your ethical obligation, of course, is to refuse the tickets—politely. Your relationship with Ray is important, but doing the right thing—and keeping your job—is important too.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p02">At some point in your selling career—in fact, probably at many points—you will be faced with a situation that challenges your ethics. At these times, it is best to follow your code of ethics and the company’s code of ethics; when in doubt, don’t make an exception. If you’re having trouble finding the motivation to refuse a gift or accurately detail your résumé, remember that you will very like be found out—and when you’re found out, you will be very lucky not to lose your job. Is the case of wine from a supplier worth losing your job over? But more important, when you fail an ethical challenge, you trade in your integrity. If you are tempted to inflate your expense report by fifty dollars, ask yourself, “Is my integrity worth more than fifty dollars?” The answer, of course, is that your integrity is worth more than any amount of money—and once gone, it cannot be bought back. Ken Lay, former CEO of Enron, was a man with a great reputation and an oil portrait displayed at his alma mater; once his crimes were discovered, however, his name was forever associated with a willingness to break the law and exploit his own employees.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_056">“Ken Lay’s Final Act,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, July 6, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/opinion/06thurs4.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/opinion/06thurs4.html</a> (accessed September 1, 2009).</span></p>

Most of them have to operate in the gray a lot of the time…because of the aggressiveness with which the targets are set of the way in which their achievement of those targets is rewarded, intelligent, honest people suddenly think that this act is OK: because within that environment it seems to be OK.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p04">Finding yourself in a corrupt corporate culture is not reason enough to violate your own code of ethics or break the law. If you find yourself in a situation where you feel pressured to do something unethical (or even illegal), talk to your supervisor about it. If you don’t feel that you can talk to your supervisor—or your supervisor is part of the problem—talk to someone in the human resources department. Give the company a chance to resolve the situation; if they are not aware of it, they can’t make it right.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s01_s11_p05">If you’re wondering about how the role of human resources works in a situation like this, it might be helpful to think about an analogy: When you were in high school and you went out with your friends, your mother, at some point or another (or perhaps every Friday night!), must have given you a talk that went something like this: “I want you to have a good time with your friends—but if anything happens, just call us and we’ll come pick you up and we won’t be mad. If there’s drinking at the party, or if someone has drugs, just call us if you need to, OK?” While you probably won’t be calling your mom when an ethical problem arises at work (much as you might secretly like to), you <em class="emphasis">can</em> call the human resources department. Human resources departments oversee hiring, promotions, and performance reviews, but they also deal with employee relations and can provide confidential counseling to workers. It is important for a company’s success that employee goals align with corporate goals; when this is the case, the corporate culture is considered “successful.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_058">David Towers, “An Investigation into Whether Organisational Culture Is Directly Linked to Motivation and Performance through Looking at Google Inc.,” extended essay, The University of Birmingham, The Birmingham Business School, 2005–6, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.towers.fr/essays/culture%20performance%20and%20motivation%20review%20and%20the%20google%20case%20study%20success.pdf">http://www.towers.fr/essays/culture%20performance%20and%20motivation %20review%20and%20the%20google%20case%20study%20success.pdf</a> (accessed September 1, 2009).</span> If your supervisor is involved in the wrongdoing, the human resources department can be an excellent resource for you.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s05_p01">Whatever company you end up working for will have its own policies with which you will need to familiarize yourself. But most companies include the same basic issues that are frequently encountered in sales: conflicts of interest, bribes, and noncompete clauses. The specifics of these policies will vary from company to company, but this section will give you a good idea of what to expect, the meaning of key terms you will encounter, and some sample policies to study.</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s05_p02">Most companies include a gift and entertainment policy in its employee handbook. IBM has a specific policy that covers these areas.</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s05_bl01">
                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s05_p11">No IBM employee, or any member of his or her immediate family, can accept gratuities or gifts of money from a supplier, customer, or anyone in a business relationship. Nor can they accept a gift or consideration that could be perceived as having been offered because of the business relationship. “Perceived” simply means this: if you read about it in your local paper, would you wonder whether the gift just might have something to do with a business relationship? No IBM employee can give money or a gift of significant value to a supplier if it could reasonably be viewed as being done to gain a business advantage. If an employee is offered money or a gift of some value by a supplier or if one arrives at their home or office, a manager should be informed immediately. If the gift is perishable, the manager will arrange to donate it to a local charitable organization. Otherwise, it should be returned to the supplier. Whatever the circumstances, the employee or the manager should write the supplier a letter, explain IBM’s guidelines on the subject of gifts and gratuities. Of course, it is an accepted practice to talk business over a meal. So it is perfectly all right to occasionally allow a supplier or customer to pick up the check. Similarly, it frequently is necessary for a supplier, including IBM, to provide education and executive briefings for customers. It’s all right to accept or provide some services in connection with this kind of activity—services such as transportation, food, or lodging. For instance, transportation in IBM or supplier planes to and from company locations, and lodging and food at company facilities are all right. A violation of these policies may result in termination.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_062">Milton Snoeyenbos, Robert Almeder, and James Humber, <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics</em> (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 2001), 133.</span></p>

Bribery can take place in many different venues. Pharmaceutical companies attempt to persuade doctors to prescribe their products by buying them meals and giving them pens and other trinkets as well as trips to medical conventions. Business gifts are considered a form of bribery when they are given by someone who could benefit from having influence on a decision maker. For example, if you are the buyer of electronics at Wal-Mart, you are not able to accept any gifts from vendors or prospective vendors as it might appear to influence your buying decisions for the chain.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s05_p09">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noncompete agreement</a><span class="glossdef">A contract that prevents you from taking a job with a competitor after you’ve quit or been fired.</span></span> (sometimes called a covenant not to compete, or CNC) prevents an employee from entering into competition with the employer once his job has ended—in other words, it prevents you from taking a job with a competitor after you’ve quit or been fired. A noncompete agreement may also prevent former employees from starting their own businesses in the same field. The reasoning behind the CNC is the fear that a former executive could take his insider knowledge and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">trade secrets</a><span class="glossdef">Something (as a formula) which has economic value to a business because it is not generally known or easily discoverable by observation and for which efforts have been made to maintain secrecy.</span></span>—as well as his contacts—with him to a new position. No employer wants to expose its strategy to its competitors. Noncompete agreements are generally upheld by the courts as long as they contain reasonable limits as to the time period and geographical space—that is, for example, that you may not compete in the state for two years after your termination. Noncompete agreements are not legal in California, although there are still measures in place in that state to protect trade secrets.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_065">“California Non-compete Agreements,” Lawzilla, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://lawzilla.com/content/noncompete.shtml">http://lawzilla.com/content/noncompete.shtml</a> (accessed September 2, 2009).</span> Not every job will ask you to sign a noncompete agreement, and if you haven’t signed one, then there are no restrictions on your future employment. This is one reason it’s so important to read and understand anything you sign. However, even if you don’t sign a noncompete agreement, you may be asked to sign a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nondisclosure agreement (or confidentiality agreement)</a><span class="glossdef">A contract that protects the secrecy of information that is exchanged.</span></span> or your company may have a nondisclosure or confidentiality policy that requires you to protect your former employer’s trade secrets; you may not exploit that information in future employment.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_066">Gene Quinn, “What Is a Confidentiality Agreement?” IPWatchdog, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2008/01/03/what-is-confidentiality-agreement/id=31">http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2008/01/03/what-is-confidentiality-agreement/id=31</a> (accessed September 2, 2009).</span> A trade secret is “any kind of information that allows you to make money because it is not known.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_067">“What Is a Trade Secret and How Is It Different from a Patent or Copyright?” HowStuffWorks, April 30, 2001, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.howstuffworks.com/question625.htm#">http://www.howstuffworks.com/question625.htm#</a> (accessed February 14, 2010).</span> For example, Coca-Cola’s signature formula is a trade secret, as is the recipe for Kentucky Fried Chicken.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s01_p10">If you find yourself between jobs and worry about the legality of finding another (having signed a noncompete agreement with your previous employer), bear in mind that noncompete agreements are most likely to be enforceable if your new job is strikingly similar to your old job. If you go from the sales department at Target to the advertising department of Kmart, you are probably (legally) in the clear.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_068">Russell Beck, “Noncompete Agreements That Don’t Mean What They Say,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of New England Technology</em>, September 5, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/09/01/focus4-Noncompete-agreements-that-dont-mean-what-they-say.html">http://www.masshightech.com/stories/2008/09/01/focus4-Noncompete-agreements-that-dont-mean-what-they-say.html</a> (accessed February 14, 2010).</span> Your new job is different enough that you are unlikely to be seen by the court as exploiting your knowledge of Target’s sales practices.

He says of himself, “The word whistle-blower suggests that you’re a tattletale or that you’re somehow disloyal. But I wasn’t disloyal in the least bit. People were dying. I was loyal to a higher order of ethical responsibility.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_069">Chuck Salter, “Jeffrey Wigand: The Whistle-Blower,” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 19, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/articles/2002/05/wigand.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/articles/2002/05/wigand.html</a> (accessed February 14, 2010).</span> Wigand’s testimony against the tobacco industry, his claims that executives at Brown &amp; Williamson knew that cigarettes were addictive, lied about it under oath, and destroyed documents related to that fact, led directly to the lawsuit brought by forty state attorneys general against tobacco companies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Whistle-blowing, the act of publicly exposing the misconduct of a company or organization, is a courageous act. Wigand’s reputation was destroyed by a punitive smear campaign conducted by the industry he spoke out against, and the stress resulting from that and the trial destroyed his marriage. Brown &amp; Williamson filed a lawsuit against him for revealing confidential company information (the suit was dismissed as a condition of the $368 billion settlement against the tobacco industry).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_070">Jeffrey Wigand, “Biography,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jeffreywigand.com/bio.php">http://www.jeffreywigand.com/bio.php</a> (accessed September 2, 2009).</span> But Wigand blew the whistle in order to save thousands of lives.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s02_p04">Of course, whistle-blowing exists on a less grand scale. If you know which of your classmates stole the answer key to an exam and you tell the professor, you have blown the whistle. Whistle-blowing doesn’t always involve risking your life, and it doesn’t always involve bringing a corporation to its knees. At its heart, it is action taken to reveal wrongdoings in hopes of seeing justice done.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s02_p05">Only limited protection existed for whistle-blowers until recently; today, the best protection they have (unless they work for the federal government) is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, mentioned earlier, which states that “whoever knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_071">Cornell University Law School, “Retaliating against a Witness, Victim, or Informant,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1513.html#e">http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1513.html#e</a> (accessed September 2, 2009).</span> It’s important to bear in mind that you have no obligation to blow the whistle; you can simply refuse to take part in any unethical or illegal activity. If you know that crimes are being committed at your place of business, you have to decide for yourself what form that refusal will take: you may simply not commit any crimes yourself, you may try to persuade others to behave ethically, or you may feel that you must resign your position. It will depend on your situation and your personal code of ethics.</p>

An increasing number of cases of fraud committed via social networking sites have taken place. There have been cases of people who create Twitter profiles in the names of other, real people.

In 1914, the Clayton Act became the first federal statute to expressly prohibit price discrimination in several forms. Large chain grocery stores used their buying power to negotiate lower prices than smaller, independent grocery stores were offered. The Robinson-Patman Act was passed in 1936, during the Great Depression, as a direct response to that unfair business practice, closing the loophole.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_073">Donald S.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Culture and Ethics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s04_p01">When you are working in a different country, or with professionals from other cultures, there may be different ideas as to what is appropriate and ethical. The Japanese, for example, have a culture of corporate gift giving; <em class="emphasis">kosai hi</em> (literally “expense for friendly relations”)<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_076">Boye Lafayette de Mente, <em class="emphasis">Japan’s Cultural Code Words</em> (North Clarendon, VT: Tuttle Publishing, 2004), 225.</span> refers to the Japanese business practice of maintaining large expense accounts used for entertaining clients and nurturing other professional relationships. This money is, for example, often used to buy golf club memberships as gifts for people with whom Japanese businessmen and women have valuable working relationships. When you come face-to-face with these different customs, it is important not to be insulting, but you also cannot ignore your company’s policies. “When in Rome” will only carry you so far.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s04_p02">A good rule of thumb is this: if you wouldn’t be comfortable telling your boss about it, or if you’d be embarrassed to tell your mom about it, don’t do it. If you’re working for a company that does business in more than one country, odds are they will have a liaison from each country that can help you to navigate the intricacies of cultural difference. In Middle Eastern countries, there is a custom of <em class="emphasis">baksheesh</em>, a word that encompasses everything from tipping to alms for a beggar to out-and-out bribery. If you are working in the Middle East, there may be an expectation that you will help to grease the wheels; your supervisor should be able to brief you on company policy in such situations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_077">S. E. Smith, “What Is Baksheesh?” wiseGEEK, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-baksheesh.htm">http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-baksheesh.htm</a> (accessed February 14, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s04_p03">One excellent example of the ethical struggles unique to international business can be found in Michael Crichton’s book <em class="emphasis">Rising Sun</em>, which deals with the clash of Japanese and American business practices. At one point, two police officers are discussing how often they are offered gifts by the Japanese: “Giving gifts to ensure that you will be seen favorably is something the Japanese do by instinct. And it’s not so different from what we do, when we invite the boss over for dinner. Goodwill is goodwill. But we don’t invite the boss over for dinner when we’re up for a promotion. The proper thing to do is to invite the boss early in the relationship, when nothing is at stake. Then it’s just goodwill. The same with the Japanese. They believe you should give the gift early, because then it is not a bribe. It is a gift. A way of making a relationship with you before there is any pressure on the relationship.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_078">Michael Crichton, <em class="emphasis">Rising Sun</em> (New York: Ballantine Books, 1992), 136.</span> When you need to decline a gift yourself, apologize and explain that company guidelines prohibit your acceptance of the gift. You should then promptly report the gift to your supervisor.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s02_s04_l01">
                <li>Your company will make available to you their policies on various ethical issues in the <strong class="emphasis bold">employee handbook</strong>; it is your responsibility to read the materials provided and remain familiar with their contents.</li>
                <li>There are four different types of <strong class="emphasis bold">conflicts of interest</strong>: <strong class="emphasis bold">family interests</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">gifts</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">private use of employer property</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">moonlighting</strong>.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bribery</strong>, the use of gifts to influence someone, is both unethical and illegal.</li>
                <li>Many employers will require you to sign a <strong class="emphasis bold">noncompete agreement</strong>; be sure that you understand the details before you agree.</li>
                <li>A company’s <strong class="emphasis bold">trade secrets</strong> should never be disclosed.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Whistle-blowing</strong>, the exposure of a company’s wrongdoing to the public, is never your ethical obligation—you are obligated only to refuse to participate. However, it can be a deeply noble act. You must analyze the situation yourself and decide what is called for.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002</strong> regulates corporate financial practices and provides protection for whistle-blowers.</li>
                <li>While different cultures have different ideas about what is ethical, working in a different country or with a client from another culture does not excuse you from following company policies regarding gifts, and so on.</li>

                <li>Review the employee handbook of the company for which you work (or have worked). What are the company policies as they relate to travel expenses? How do you substantiate your travel expenses in order to get reimbursement? What are the company policies as they relate to confidentiality? What kind of information do you know that might be considered confidential?</li>
                <li>Identify a situation in which you found yourself facing a conflict of interest: perhaps you had two after-school activities with equal claims on your time, or maybe you wanted to use your part-time job to give discounts to your friends. How did you resolve the conflict? Would you handle things differently if faced with the same situation again?</li>
                <li>Research a whistle-blower not mentioned in this chapter. Who was he or she, and what did he or she expose? Do you agree with his or her decision to blow the whistle? Why or why not?</li>
                <li>Find an example of someone who took part in bribery and was found out. Who was he or she, and what were the consequences of his or her illegal actions?</li>
                <li>Describe what is meant by confidentiality. What does a company expect when a company policy states that employees are bound by confidentiality?</li>
                <li>Describe the difference between unethical and illegal behavior. Is unethical behavior always illegal?</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_p01">You’ve been asked to submit your résumé because your roommate knows someone in the marketing department at a major national food company. You really want this job, but you are concerned that you don’t really have the qualifications yet. As you work on your résumé, you exercise your creativity: “cashier” becomes “marketing representative.” You add to your skills “management of personnel”—of course, you don’t have any management experience, but you just know you’ll be good at it. By the time you’ve finished, you are surprised to realize that, looking at your résumé, you don’t recognize yourself. Maybe this truth-stretching exercise wasn’t such a good idea.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_p02">Behaving in an ethical fashion throughout the hiring process only strengthens your personal brand—and that’s just good business.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selling Yourself versus Stretching the Truth about Your Background and Experience</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_s01_p01">When you create your résumé, you are selling yourself to potential employers; where do you draw the line between putting your best foot forward and stretching the truth past the breaking point? The difference between “attended Pacific Coast Baptist College” and “received degrees in theology and psychology from Pacific Coast Baptist College” can be the difference between a successful tenure and an embarrassing resignation, as former RadioShack CEO David Edmondson discovered in 2006.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn04_079">Associated Press, “RadioShack CEO Resigns amid Resume Questions,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, February 20, 2006, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2006-02-20-radioshack-ceo_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2006-02-20-radioshack-ceo_x.htm</a> (accessed February 14, 2010).</span> Edmondson, by claiming that he had earned degrees he had not (and, in one case, a degree not even offered by the college), set the stage for the embarrassing scandal that cost him his job. It can be tempting to gamble on the likelihood that an employer won’t do a background check—but even if you get away with a fib once or twice, it’s not something you should bet on for your entire career. Social networking will out you. The Internet has led to professional networks that are incredibly far reaching; your boss may have a connection on LinkedIn to a manager at the company you pretend to have interned for. And, of course, lying on your résumé is unethical; you should sell <em class="emphasis">yourself</em>, not an exaggerated version of yourself.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_s01_p02">Your experiences as a waitress, cashier, retail store salesperson, babysitter, or any other part-time or summer job can be very valuable on your résumé. Being able to demonstrate that you can multitask under pressure, resolve problems quickly to customers’ satisfaction, be responsible, or increase sales are the types of skills that prospective employers are looking for from entry-level employees. Use your experience to tell a story about what makes you different and delivers value to your prospective employer. For example, if you want to pursue a career in finance, your experience handling money and balancing the cash drawer at the end of the day is important to highlight on your résumé. It’s also a good idea to put your most important and relevant internships or jobs first on your résumé rather than adhering to the traditional chronological order. Since you are just beginning your career, your most important jobs can be listed first. When you gain more experience, it’s better to use the chronological format. The bottom line is that you have a brand story to tell on your résumé; no matter what your background, you don’t need to stretch the truth.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_s01_p03">Prospective employers want to see evidence that you are hardworking and have done things to distinguish yourself by holding part-time jobs, completing internships, participating in professional organizations, performing community service, and gaining other experiences. But one thing to remember about entry-level positions in virtually every industry is that none of the hiring companies expects you to come in and do the job from day one. The company will train you to do the job it wants done. That doesn’t mean that you won’t be asked to “jump in” and do things, because you will. But companies don’t expect you to have skills and experience that you will have after a few years of working. So use your résumé to sell yourself in an honest but compelling way.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_s02_p03">When choosing references, be sure that the people you have in mind have good things to say about you. It’s a good idea to keep in touch with your former boss from your internship or summer job. People with whom you have had a good working relationship can be excellent references. It’s always best to contact someone whom you would like to be a reference in person or on the phone. That way you will be able to let them know exactly how much you respect her, and it will give you an opportunity to cement your professional relationship. If she shows any kind of hesitation, you may not want to use her as a reference.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s03_s02_p04">When you speak to a prospective reference, be professional and be specific. Here’s an example of a conversation you might have with a professor whom you are asking to be a reference. If you are asking a professor, it’s best to make an appointment or stop by his office.</p>

This is not a situation in which you want to surprise people. Instead, talk with each person; you should personally speak with each person, preferably in person or by phone as opposed to by e-mail. (By all means, avoid the group e-mail requesting references.) Explain what the job is that you are applying for and ask for her permission to list her as a reference. Always personally thank each of your references, even if you don’t get the job. Express your gratitude—preferably in a handwritten note, but you must at least send an e-mail and let them know how things turned out. Don’t feel as if you let down your references if you didn’t get the job. Each of your references was in your situation at one point in time, and she didn’t get an offer from every job interview. Stay positive and keep in touch with your references. They will appreciate it, and you will keep your professional network strong.</p>

If you’re going to effectively sell yourself, you need to believe in your personal brand. A reminder that Dr. Messimer thinks that you’re awesome could be just the pick-me-up you need in order to dust yourself off and reenter the job market with aplomb.</p>

                <li>Lying on your résumé is not ethical and can have catastrophic consequences for your career.</li>
                <li>It is in your best interests to market yourself on your résumé—list your internships first, then your jobs, including any “nonprofessional” jobs that are important to the history of your personal brand.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Personal references</strong> are family and friends; <strong class="emphasis bold">professional references</strong> are people whom you have worked with, and are vastly more important.</li>
                <li>Have at least three professional references available. Present your references only if asked for them; do not include them on your résumé.</li>
                <li>Speak to each of your references before you provide their name and contact information to a prospective employer. Get their permission, thank them, and let them know how things worked out.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Letters of recommendation</strong> are important testaments to your character and abilities; when you finish an internship or a class, ask your supervisor or professor for a letter of recommendation. Letters of recommendation are excellent to present with your list of references.</li>

        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s04_p02">Now it’s time to put what you’ve learned into practice. Following are two roles that are involved in the same selling situation—one role is the customer, and the other is the salesperson. This will give you the opportunity to think about this ethical dilemma from the point of view of both the customer and the salesperson.</p>
        <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch04_s04_p03">Read each role carefully along with the discussion questions. Then, be prepared to play either of the roles in class using the concepts covered in this chapter. You may be asked to discuss the roles and do a role play in groups or individually.</p>

The holidays are coming, and one of your best customers, the owner of an independent jewelry store, has sent you an expensive gift in appreciation for all that you have done to help her increase her business over the past year. Your employee handbook makes it clear that you could be fired for accepting it, but you didn’t actually accept it; it just turned up at your home, neatly wrapped, with a card attached.
