    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_p01">Now you know about an elevator pitch and how it can help you in your sales approach. But do you have an elevator pitch for your personal brand? If the answer is no, now is the time to craft it. Just as in selling, your personal elevator pitch should be less than a few minutes and should be a way for you to tell someone who you are, what you’ve done, and what you’re looking for. Your elevator pitch will serve as the approach for your internship and job search in several different ways.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s01_p01">Your elevator pitch is critical because it tells a prospective employer or someone in your network what you have to offer, what makes you different, and what you want to do. You’ll use your elevator pitch in many different situations; you may even use it in situations when you least expect it. Chris O’Leary, author of <em class="emphasis">Elevator Pitch Essentials</em>, suggests that many people are not prepared to take advantage of relationships and opportunities that come their way simply because they are not prepared with a compelling statement about who they are and what they are looking for.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_095">Chris O’Leary, “Elevator Pitch 101,” Elevator Pitch Essentials, January 27, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html">http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s02_p01">Before you can deliver your elevator pitch, you have to write it first. Start by reviewing your brand positioning points that you identified in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>. As you recall, your brand positioning points are the foundation of your résumé and cover letter and now your elevator pitch. You can see how you are building a consistent brand story by always focusing on the same key selling points about yourself.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s02_p05">This is an example of a telephone approach. You can see that it is concise and to the point. If you are networking, at a job interview, or talking with someone, you might have the time for one or two more sentences, but not much more. The secret to an effective elevator pitch is to intrigue the listener so that he wants to hear more. If your elevator pitch is compelling and brief, the listener will respond by asking a question, and you will get the conversation started.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">When to Use Your Elevator Pitch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p01">One of the most common uses for an elevator pitch is networking. For example, if you attend a professional event you’ll have the opportunity to meet many new people. And you’ll want to tell each one a little bit about yourself. This is a perfect opportunity to use your elevator pitch; it’s not too long and gives you the perfect way to start a conversation and give the person to whom you are speaking the chance to ask a question. You might even find something or someone in common as a result of the information in your elevator pitch: “You were an intern at Classic Architects? My brother used to work there. His name is Jeremy Slater. Do you know him?”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p02">Another opportunity to use your elevator pitch is in an interview. Although you will need more preparation than simply your elevator pitch for an informational interview or a job interview, you will have a head start on your preparation with a strong elevator pitch. It’s the perfect response to what is commonly the first question that is asked at almost every job interview: “So tell me about yourself.” It’s important to be ready with a clear, concise, and compelling statement. If you think you can wing it, you will probably start your interview off on the wrong foot. On the other hand, a good elevator pitch allows you to direct the conversation to the things you want to talk about (your brand positioning points).</p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p03">It might be challenging to think about communicating your brand story in only sixty seconds, but don’t forget your objective: you want to get the internship or job. While there’s a long way between your elevator pitch and an internship or job, keep your eye on the prize; always have a call to action as part of your elevator pitch. For example, ask for a business card from everyone with whom you speak or meet. That means that whether you are at a networking event or on a job interview, it’s always appropriate to ask the person for their business card. (You might want to brush up and review the business card etiquette covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch05#fwk-125752-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Power of Effective Communication"</a>.)</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p04">Then, follow-up is key. After you meet someone, follow up with an e-mail or phone call within twenty-four hours (or on the appropriate date after an interview). Tell the person how much you enjoyed meeting her and mention something specific about your conversation. It’s a good idea to include a link to an interesting article or video in your e-mail; that will help you stand out in the person’s mind.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s04_p01">Your elevator pitch is a reflection of you, so when you are creating your elevator pitch, write it down, and then say it out loud in front of a mirror until you are comfortable with it. It’s important to rehearse it so that you are comfortable with communicating this brand message in just a few minutes without rambling or stumbling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_098">Laura Raines, “Making Your Pitch,” <em class="emphasis">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, Jobs, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2007_0225_elevatorsp.html">http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2007_0225_elevatorsp.html</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span> But you don’t want to have your elevator pitch down cold; in other words, you want to deliver it with ease and with a natural tone and pacing, as if you were saying it for the first time. It’s hard to get the balance between preparation and spontaneity, which is why it’s a good idea to use your elevator pitch frequently. That way you will be able to feel natural saying it and make adjustments based on how it sounds and feels. And don’t forget to smile!</p>
