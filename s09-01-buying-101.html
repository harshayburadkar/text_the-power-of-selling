    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_p01">You walk into an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch store at the mall, and without thinking about it, you turn to the right and make your way through the denim, past the belts, and to the sweaters. You are so engaged in the experience that you didn’t even realize that the huge mural at the entrance to the store serves a purpose other than to make you look twice at the hot model in the larger-than-life photo. Before you know it, one of the oh-so-gorgeous salespeople dressed in Abercrombie from head to toe approaches you with a smile. “These hoodies are awesome,” she says as you pick up the pale blue one.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_p02">Shopping. It’s the national pastime for some but a detested necessity for others. Whether you love shopping (“Oh, that is sooooooo cute!”) or do everything to avoid it (“I’m not going to the mall, no matter what”), it is a major source of spending in the United States. In fact, the retail industry generated $4.475 trillion in sales in 2008, including everything from products and services in retail stores and e-commerce to food service and automotive.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_001">Barbara Farfan, “Retail Industry Information: Overview of Facts, Research, Data, and Trivia,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://retailindustry.about.com/od/statisticsresearch/p/retailindustry.htm">http://retailindustry.about.com/od/statisticsresearch/p/retailindustry.htm</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span> That’s a lot of selling—and a lot of buying. But what makes you stop and pick up one sweater but not another? What makes you buy a pair of jeans you weren’t even looking for? What makes you walk out of the store spending more than you had planned?</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Inside Consumer Behavior</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s01_p01">The science of consumer behavior describes and even defines how you shop and, more importantly, why you buy. Smart retailers study consumer behavior patterns and lay out their stores and merchandise accordingly. For example, did you know that 86 percent of women look at price tags when they shop, while only 72 percent of men do?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_002">Paco Underhill, <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em> (New York: Touchstone, 1999), 99.</span> And did you know that the average shopper doesn’t actually notice anything that’s in the entrance of a store? According to Paco Underhill, famous marketer, CEO and founder of EnviroSell, and author of the book <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em>, consumers don’t actually begin shopping until a certain point after they enter the store. That’s why smart retailers include a “transition zone” at the entry to their store; it allows customers to get their bearings and choose their shopping paths. In other words, products, signs, and displays that are in the very front of the store might not be seen if there is not a transition for the customers when they enter. In the case of Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, the transition is the space just inside the entrance that includes the humongous photo of the Abercrombie model du jour. When you go into Hollister, it’s the outside porch that serves the same purpose; it’s a transition that allows you to get your focus and plot your course in the store, even if you don’t consciously realize it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s01_p02">Think about the last time you went into a grocery store or drug store; you might not have noticed anything until you were well inside the store, which means that the merchandise and signs that were displayed in the area before you got your bearings were virtually invisible to you.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_003">Paco Underhill, <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em> (New York: Touchstone, 1999), 46.</span> Based on consumer research, there’s a high likelihood that you turned right when you entered the store. Take note the next time you go shopping; chances are, you’ll turn right after you walk in.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_004">Paco Underhill, <em class="emphasis">Why We Buy: The Science of Shopping</em> (New York: Touchstone, 1999), 46.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s01_p03">Understanding how and why customers buy can make a significant difference in how you sell. Is the product a considered purchase, like a computer or car, or an impulse buy, like a sweater or music download? Is the product bought frequently, like an energy drink, or only once every few years or even once in a lifetime, like a car or a college education? For each of these products, the customer goes through a buying process. Understanding the customer and the buying process can make your selling efforts successful. This video featuring Martin Lindstrom, the author of <em class="emphasis">Buyology: Truths and Lies about Why We Buy</em>, highlights the science of consumer behavior in selling and marketing</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p01">When Hurricane Katrina hit the United States on August 28, 2005, the Gulf Coast was devastated. Thousands of people were stranded for days, some without food, water, or shelter due to overwhelming flooding. Almost two thousand people lost their lives in the natural disaster.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_008">United States Department of Health and Human Services, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/emergency/naturaldisasters/hurricanes/katrina/index.html">http://www.hhs.gov/disasters/emergency/naturaldisasters/hurricanes/katrina/index.html</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> During those horrible days and in the aftermath, those who were affected by the catastrophe did not care what kind of car they drove, what anyone did for a living, or if they forgot to sign up for French or scuba lessons. They were focused on the basics: food, shelter, and clothing.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p02">This tragedy is a demonstration of exactly how <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Maslow’s hierarchy of needs</a><span class="glossdef">The behavior theory that recognizes that people are motivated by their most basic needs first; only after those needs are met do they strive to meet higher-level needs.</span></span> works. Abraham Maslow is among the most renowned psychologists of the twentieth century. His theory explains human behavior in simple terms: A hierarchy of needs that begins with the most basic of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">physiological needs</a><span class="glossdef">The most basic elements required to survive such as food, shelter, and clothing.</span></span> (e.g., food, water, shelter, and clothing) motivates people, and when the lowest-level needs are satisfied, they are no longer motivators.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_009"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p03">During the days after Hurricane Katrina hit, people were rescued and provided with water, food, and shelter. Many were relocated to temporary housing or even to housing outside the affected areas. It was not until after the physiological needs were met that people became concerned about the next level of needs on Maslow’s hierarchy: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">safety needs</a><span class="glossdef">Concerns for personal security and well-being.</span></span>. Looting of shops in some of the cities began to occur, and there was even concern that the police force in some cities was not taking an active role in arresting those who were breaking the law.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_010">Associated Press, “Looters Take Advantage of New Orleans Mess,” <em class="emphasis">msnbc.com</em>, August 30, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9131493">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9131493</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> The people of the Gulf Coast were no longer motivated by simply getting water, food, or shelter; they had moved up Maslow’s hierarchy and were concerned about their personal security and well-being.</p>

They searched for options to put their children back in school, ways to get jobs, and options to rebuild their lives. By Christmas 2005, people stopped to celebrate the holiday together. According to a story reported by CBS Evening News on December 25, 2005, about the Christmas gatherings in New Orleans, “The will to be home for the holidays outweighed everything else.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_011">Joel Roberts, “Christmas After Katrina,” <em class="emphasis">CBS Evening News</em>, December 25, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/25/eveningnews/main1165360.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/12/25/eveningnews/main1165360.shtml</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> By this time, they were motivated by <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social needs</a><span class="glossdef">Bonds or attachments to other people and feelings of love and belonging.</span></span>, or the need to belong and have an attachment or bond to others.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_012"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p05">Slowly but surely, people began to rebuild their lives and their cities. People took on leadership roles and began to take recovery to the next level. Even people who were hundreds of miles away from the hurricane-ravaged area wanted to help. Volunteers from all over the country began to make the pilgrimage to the Gulf Coast to help in any way they could. In fact, volunteer vacations to help rebuild cities such as New Orleans became commonplace and are still going on today.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn06_013">Sheryl Kane, “Volunteer Vacations: Rebuilding New Orleans,” June 26, 2009, SingleMindedWomen, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://singlemindedwomen.com/2009/06/rebuilding-new-orleans">http://singlemindedwomen.com/2009/06/rebuilding-new-orleans</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> This is an example of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">esteem needs</a><span class="glossdef">Feelings of being respected and appreciated by one’s peers.</span></span>, or the need to feel respected and appreciated by one’s peers.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s03_p08">This all comes together at the point of sale, whether you are selling in business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) environments. When you understand the motivation of your customer, you can customize your solution and your message to meet their needs, emotions, and motivations. Consider the Hurricane Katrina example; would you attempt to sell fine jewelry, pitch the benefits of a landscaping service, or suggest a home theater system to someone in New Orleans on August 29, 2005? Probably not. People were focused on their most basic needs at that time, and none of these products or services would have been appropriate to sell. Although this may seem like an extreme example, it’s a good way to remember to look at the world through your customer’s eyes, as you’ll see a completely different view. Now that you can see what motivates people to buy, it’s time to learn who is buying. Although the buying process is similar for B2C and B2B, there are some distinct differences that can make a difference in the way you sell.</p>

So, whether you are buying a cell phone and service at a Verizon store, a music download from iTunes, or a burger and fries at Burger King, you are buying in the B2C arena. Even though you may behave differently than your brother or roommate in terms of your purchasing decisions, you are all described as B2C customers because you are the ultimate consumer of the products or services you buy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s06_p01">B2C and B2B purchasers are different for several reasons. The most important differentiator is that consumers purchase for their own consumption (or the consumption of their household or friends), whereas B2B customers purchase to produce or resell the product to a company or the ultimate consumer. There are also several other key differences between B2C and B2B buyers. Generally, B2C buying is based—for the most part—on impulse, low-risk decisions for products and services that are readily accessible. Whether you shop online, in a store, or at a direct selling party, your buying decisions impact only yourself and your family and do not put you at risk. Although you may make some significant buying decisions such as a house or a car, your options are easily accessible (go online, go to the mall or store), and your decisions don’t put you in danger of losing anything—except, of course, if you spend money you don’t have.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s06_s01_p01">Because B2C buyers are purchasing only for their consumption or for the consumption of a limited number of people, the size of the purchases is relatively small. By contrast, B2B purchases are significant because the companies are purchasing to sell to other companies or to many consumers.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s06_s02_p01">If you think it’s difficult to keep everyone in your apartment happy with the food purchases you make at the supermarket, that’s easy compared to the number of people involved in a B2B purchasing decision. In most B2B transactions, there are multiple decision makers involved in each purchase. Think about your trip to the supermarket from the B2B buyer’s perspective. The decision about which products to stock on the shelves was ultimately made by someone who holds the title of “buyer” in the company. However, she could not decide unilaterally what to carry in the bottled water section. She has to understand which bottled water her customers want, consult with the general merchandise manager, who is responsible for the shelf space, and the vice president of merchandising, who oversees all product choices. She may even need to make a presentation to a buying committee before she makes the decision to carry another flavor of Vitaminwater. She will need to get approval for the money to invest in the inventory and shelf space. Depending on the organization and the size and impact of the decision, several people from several different departments may be involved in a B2B buying decision.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s07_s03_p01">At the end of the day, it is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">decision maker</a><span class="glossdef">The person or people who are responsible for making the final purchasing decision at a company.</span></span> or decision makers who will make the final purchasing decision. Decision makers could be anyone who holds the responsibility or accountability for making buying decisions for the company. In the case of the e-mail and social networking technology purchase, depending on the company, the decision maker might be the CEO, the head of the marketing department, or even a committee of people from marketing, IT, and customer service. A smart decision maker involves the users and influencers in her decision-making process to make the best choice. An investment in technology will not only be expensive, but will last for years; once a company makes a commitment to integrate their systems with a technology company, it is not practical to make frequent changes. The decision making process in B2B can take days, weeks, months, or even years to make, depending on the company and the product or service being purchased.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s07_s04_p01">When you are selling in a B2B environment, you may not always have access to the ultimate decision maker. But building a relationship with the initiator, influencers, and users can be just as important and effective as meeting with the decision maker. However, you should always be aware of the “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">power level</a><span class="glossdef">The level in a company or organization at which the buying decision is made.</span></span>,” or exactly the level in the organization that is making the buying decision. Sometimes, salespeople don’t get to the power level, but instead stop at one or two levels below that critical level where the purchasing decision is being made. If the vice president of human resources is making the decision as to which vendor to choose for the company’s training programs, it’s important to build a relationship with her. Having a relationship with the director of training is critical, but a successful salesperson wouldn’t stop there; he would work to secure a relationship at the power level, which is the vice president. This video discusses the power level and its importance to success in selling.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch06_s01_s08_p01">There’s still more you can learn about the B2B buying environment. Although companies are so different from each other (some are large multinational corporations while others are one-person operations) and the types of products and services being purchased are so different (everything from business cards to office buildings), it might seem difficult to know how to apply the concepts covered to every buying situation. One way is to understand the different types of buying situations that face a B2B buyer.</p>

Usually, straight rebuys are consumable products or supplies such as office supplies, maintenance supplies, or parts. This is an opportunity for you to shine, whether the customer is currently purchasing from you or not. When purchases are on “auto pilot,” sometimes the salesperson gets lazy, takes the business for granted, and doesn’t go the extra mile to suggest something new or better. If a prospective customer is already buying from someone else, you have the opportunity to win her over by suggesting a better or more efficient product, a different pack size or method of replenishment, or other ideas that will help the customer save time or money or increase quality. For straight rebuys, it is often price that gets the customer’s attention, but it is service (or lack of it) that makes the customer switch providers.</p>

Selling to a customer who is purchasing a modified rebuy is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your flexibility and creativity. Many times, customers have an idea in mind for a modification, but if you can bring them ideas and insights that will help them increase their business profitably, you will have the upper hand in securing the buy.</p>
