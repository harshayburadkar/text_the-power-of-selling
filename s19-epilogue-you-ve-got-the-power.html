    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch16_p02">You’ve met sales professionals and learned the importance of ethics, communication, and relationships. You’ve practiced the seven steps of the selling process and participated in role-plays to hone your skills. You’ve even learned how to market yourself as a brand and sell yourself to get the internship or job you want.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch16_p03">This is it. This is where it all comes together…the real world. Whether you are graduating or getting ready for your next semester, you’ll be able to use your selling skills to get what you want in life. And don’t forget the tips you learned in <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> about selling the most important product of all: yourself.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch16_p04">In addition to all the things you learned in this book, here’s the one thing you should remember every day: <em class="emphasis">believe</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch16_p05">Believe in the products and services you sell, believe in your company, believe in your customers. But most of all, believe in yourself. You can do anything you want to do in life with your newfound selling skills and a true belief that you can do it. The fact is you have the skills and the knowledge and now you have the power to achieve. Even on those days when the wind is at your face, remember that <em class="emphasis">you</em> are the most important product you will ever sell. Customers and prospective employers buy you before they buy your products, services, or even your skills. They want to believe in you, and that’s why it’s so important that you believe in yourself.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch16_p06">Put your selling skills to work every day and remember…you’ve got the power!</p>
