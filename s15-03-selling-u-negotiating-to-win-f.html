This is the stage of the job searching process that really tests your mettle to get what you want. Just like negotiating and closing (outlined in the previous sections of this chapter), the quality of the job offer starts long before you actually receive the offer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s01_p01">Before you even begin thinking about looking for an internship or job, your first step should be to determine your value based on the marketplace. As with every step of the selling process, doing your homework is key. If you don’t do your research to find out competitive compensation packages for the position and city in which you are seeking an internship or job, you might be disappointed with the job offers you receive.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s01_p02">There are several Web sites—Salary.com, JobStar.com, and SalaryExpert.com are just a few—that include compensation ranges for hundreds of different positions in areas across the country.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s01_s01_p01">Just as in the selling process, establishing your value begins with your first contact with your prospective employer. Many times you have the opportunity to meet at least one or two people at the company, usually someone in human resources as well as your hiring manager. In some cases, you may meet with several different people with whom you will be working. In some cases, you may also talk with or meet with a recruiter. At any rate, you have the opportunity to establish your value with as many people as you meet. Everything you say and do has an impact on how people perceive you and your value. Are your résumé and cover letter professional? Did you do your research before you contacted the employer? How did you make contact? When you went in for an interview, did you dress appropriately and professionally? Were you prepared for the interview? Did you bring samples of your work to demonstrate your skills? Did you follow up with a thank-you e-mail and handwritten thank-you note within twenty-four hours? All these elements help establish your value long before an offer is extended. When it comes to making an impression on a prospective employer, everything matters.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s01_s01_p02">Just as in the selling process, if you do your homework and establish your value early in the process, you will be more likely to get the offer you want.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Compensation versus Salary</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s01_s02_p01">One thing to know before you walk into any interview: compensation is different from salary. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Compensation</a><span class="glossdef">Money and benefits received in exchange for providing services to a company including elements such as salary, commission, bonus, benefits, and any other elements in payment for providing services.</span></span> is the total amount of money and benefits that you are paid for a particular position. Compensation can include salary, insurance, vacation or sick leave, stock options, signing bonus, car allowance, 401(k), child care or elder care assistance, and any other type of payment received in exchange for your services to the company. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Salary</a><span class="glossdef">A regular payment from an employer in exchange for services.</span></span>, a fixed amount of money that is paid regularly in exchange for services provided, is only one element of compensation. When you are considering a job offer, it’s best to keep in mind that salary is not the only element of compensation. This will allow you to be creative in your negotiating as there are several elements other than salary that can be included in your total compensation package.</p>

(Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 202.</span> Just as in the selling process, you want to put focus on establishing your value and learning about what’s important to your prospective employer before you begin discussing compensation. A word of caution: you should be prepared to give your desired salary range on an interview as many employers want to understand your salary expectations as soon as possible. If you can avoid the topic, do so until you receive a job offer. Here’s an example of how you can deflect the conversation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s03_p06">It’s worth noting the time element of this negotiation. You should take as much time as you need to evaluate the offer, but you should be reasonable and state the time frame you need. Recall from earlier in this chapter that time is one of the elements that is always present in a negotiation. Sometimes a prospective employer or recruiter will try to create a deadline to force you to make a decision by a specific date. Use time to your advantage and negotiate for more time so that you don’t feel as if you are under pressure to make this important decision.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s04_p01">Congratulations on your offer! Although it’s a difficult economy, don’t feel pressured to take the first offer you get. Take the first offer you get for a job you really want. This is a special moment; it is the time when the power shifts from the prospective employer to you (remember that power is one of the elements that is always present in a negotiation). Your prospective employer has now indicated that you are their choice for the position. You have the opportunity to take the offer, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">counteroffer</a><span class="glossdef">A candidate’s response to a job offer.</span></span> (your response to the job offer), or walk away. Whatever your choice, you have the power. As soon as you make your choice, the power shifts back to your prospective employer. That’s why it’s a good idea to take your time and completely evaluate your offer before you respond.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s04_p02">Now that you have all the elements of the offer, you can begin to evaluate it.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s05_p01">After you have had the time to evaluate the job offer, it’s time to identify any gaps that there might be between what you think is important and the offer. If you think the offer is perfect as is, then accept it as is. Keep in mind that many employers expect candidates to negotiate by presenting a counteroffer, a candidate’s response to a job offer. Since the economy is challenging, candidates don’t have as much bargaining power as when the economy is healthy. However, this is the time you have the most negotiating power with your prospective employer so it’s a good idea to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s05_p02">This is the time when you should identify your prenegotiation goals. Remember that your prenegotiation goals are the minimum that you will accept. Your counteroffer will be above your prenegotiation goals to allow room for negotiation. You won’t be able to negotiate every element of the offer. Choose one or two key areas and focus your negotiation on those. Keep in mind the things that are important to you and to your prospective employer so that you can easily find common ground. For example, if speed and availability are important to your prospective employer, you may want to use that fact to negotiate a more flexible work arrangement. While it may be difficult to negotiate a higher base salary in this economy, you may be able to negotiate on another area such as getting additional vacation time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn12_081">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 208.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s05_p03">When you have identified the areas you wish to negotiate along with your counteroffer for each, contact the recruiter or prospective employer to begin the negotiation. As with any negotiation, approach it with a confident, collaborative attitude. It’s important to note that you should not accept the offer until you negotiate the offer. Once you accept the offer, you have lost your power to negotiate.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s06_p01">Once you agree on the final elements of the offer, you should ask for an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">offer letter</a><span class="glossdef">A formal letter from the company (on company letterhead) that outlines the terms of the offer for employment.</span></span>, a formal letter from the company (on company letterhead) that outlines the terms of the offer. All companies should provide an offer letter as a matter of course for an internship (paid or unpaid) or a job offer. If you received the original offer in the form of a letter, you already have the offer letter; however, you should request an updated letter to reflect the final offer on which you agreed. If you find any discrepancies in your offer letter, contact the person at the company as soon as possible to have a new offer letter issued.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch12_s03_s06_p02">A offer letter simply reiterates the terms of employment that you have negotiated and may be conditional based on requirements such as a background check or drug test or may make reference to company documents such as the benefits summary or employee handbook. While some information in offer letters may vary depending on the company, some key information should be included in the offer letter:</p>
