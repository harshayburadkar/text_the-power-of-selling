He started the concert by saying, “Welcome to the new Citi Field Stadium. It’s been a long time since I’ve been here.… I have a feeling we’re going to have a little bit of fun tonight.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650677">“Paul McCartney’s first concert at City Field,” video, July 22, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdHC6OJPShQ">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdHC6OJPShQ</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span> Then he played The Beatles’ classic “Drive My Car,” and the crowd went wild.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650692">“Paul McCartney at Citi Field Opening Song ‘Drive My Car,’” video, July 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.macca-central.com/news/?id=3070">http://www.macca-central.com/news/?id=3070</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_p02">Paul McCartney didn’t need to <em class="emphasis">talk</em> to the audience. In fact, people didn’t come to hear him speak at all; they came to hear him sing. But Paul McCartney clearly understands the power of a strong approach. His brief welcome, tip to the past, and promise for a great show were all part of his short but effective <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sales approach</a><span class="glossdef">The third step in the selling process; the point at which you make contact with the customer.</span></span>. While you might not think of Paul McCartney as a salesperson, his concerts, just like those of other rock stars and recording artists, are actually sales presentations for his new songs and albums.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_p03">In all types of selling, the approach precedes the sales presentation. In the case of the concert, you probably already know Paul McCartney and what to expect from him. But when you are meeting someone for the first time in sales, your approach won’t be successful unless you how you make a good first impression.</p>

First impressions are quickly formed, difficult to change, and can have a lasting effect.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_003">BNET Health Care Industry, “Social Perception,” BNET, March 2001, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2699/is_0003/ai_2699000324/?tag=content;col1">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g2699/is_0003/ai_2699000324/?tag=content;col1</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Think of a first date, your first day of high school or college, or any job interview you have gone into. You were probably nervous because you knew the importance of making a good first impression. Similarly, the sales approach is the most intimidating point of the sales process for many salespeople because they know that the decision to buy or not to buy can often start with this initial contact. The approach is your first phone call to your prospect, the moment on the sales floor where you walk over to a new customer and say, “That’s our newest model, and it has one terabyte of capacity. Do you record a lot of videos or music?” or your first visit to a target business when you ask to set up a meeting with your prospect. You’ve done your research, your planning, and your preparation, but the approach is where the rubber meets the road.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_p01">While prospecting and the preapproach are entirely under your control, the approach is the first part of the sales process where you actually come in contact with your prospect and you’re not quite sure what she will say; this can be a little nerve wracking. However, if you’ve researched your prospect, and if you go into the sales call prepared, you can have confidence that you will be able to adapt your sales approach to your individual customer. Keep in mind that you aren’t selling a product during your approach; you are actually introducing yourself and opening up the way for the opportunity to make your sales presentation later. Consider these six Cs, or things to keep in mind before and during your sales approach. These six points will help you anticipate your customers’ responses, adapt, and execute your approach with success.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p01">If you know your product inside and out, and you’ve set your objectives and prepared a general benefit statement, you will be well equipped going into your call, so have confidence. (On the other hand, confidence without preparation is a sure recipe for disappointment, so make sure you actually <em class="emphasis">have</em> done your homework first.) Not only will a confident attitude set the tone for the meeting and help you build credibility with your customer, but it will also help you perform your job better. As psychologist William James said, “Attitude at the beginning of a difficult task…more than anything else, will affect its successful outcome.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_004">Brian Johnson’s Philosophers Notes, “Inspirational Quotes: William James,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://philosophersnotes.com/quotes/by_teacher/William%20James">http://philosophersnotes.com/quotes/by_teacher/William%20James</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p02">Of course, feeling and appearing confident in a stressful situation is more easily said than done, but there are some simple psychological tricks that can help. For in-person sales approaches, sales coach Jim Meisenheimer suggests giving yourself an affirmation before heading into the meeting. For instance, tell yourself “This will be one of the most positive sales calls I have ever had with a new prospect.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_005">Jim Meisenheimer, “7 Things to Do to Prepare for Your First Sales Call,” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?7-Things-to-Do-to-Prepare-For-Your-First-Sales-Call&amp;amp;id=2409769">http://ezinearticles.com/?7-Things-to-Do-to-Prepare-For-Your-First-Sales-Call&amp;amp;id=2409769</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> If you believe you will succeed, it is more likely that you <em class="emphasis">will</em> succeed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s01_p03">For sales calls that happen over the phone, prepare for your call by organizing your workspace first. Clear off your desk and make sure you have everything you will need within easy reach—calendar, note pad and pen, fact sheets, precall planning worksheet, and anything else that might be helpful during the call.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_006">Craig Harrison, “Warming Up to Cold Calls,” Expressions of Excellence, Fall 2001, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/warmcoldcalls.htm">http://www.expressionsofexcellence.com/ARTICLES/warmcoldcalls.htm</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span> You should also try standing up (because people feel more powerful when they are standing) and smiling while you talk (it will relax you and will help you to use a positive, energized tone of voice).<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_007">Business Link, “Planning to Sell,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1081503204">http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?type=RESOURCES&amp;itemId=1081503204</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s02_p01">Building credibility is one of the most important challenges you will face early on in the sales call; you want to convince your customer that you are competent, that you offer valuable solutions, and that you are trustworthy.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_008">Thomas A. Freese, <em class="emphasis">Secrets of Question Based Selling</em> (Naperville, IL: Sourcebooks, Inc., 2003), 113.</span> As sales strategist Thomas A.

Freese, <em class="emphasis">Secrets of Question Based Selling</em> (Naperville, IL: Sourcebooks, Inc., 2003), 116.</span> Open the conversation by introducing yourself and your company; if you are meeting your customer in person, make eye contact and offer a firm handshake. Next, briefly explain the purpose of your call (without making your sales presentation). Your customers are busy people, and will appreciate it if you are direct. In addition, an up-front manner like this conveys trustworthiness.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s02_p02">Depending on the type of sales situation you are in, you may be approaching your prospect, or they may be approaching you. In B2B sales, you are generally approaching your prospect, so you have researched them first. While qualifications like a proven track record, satisfied customers, or number of years in sales might help establish your credibility, according to Jeff Thull, CEO of Prime Resource Group, these qualifications are expected, and listing them isn’t an effective way to lead off your sales call. Thull says <em class="emphasis">exceptional</em> credibility comes when you can demonstrate that you have done your homework. In other words, it’s not what you know about your company and your product that will impress your customer; it’s what you know about your customer and his situation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_010">Jeff Thull, “How to Establish Sales Credibility: It’s Not the Stories You Tell, It’s the Questions You Ask,” MarketingProfs, February 6, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/7/thull15.asp">http://www.marketingprofs.com/7/thull15.asp</a>; Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">The Spin Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 40.</span> Later in this chapter, you will learn about specific ways to do that.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Contact</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s03_p01">By now you might be wondering how you should approach your prospect. Do you want to make your first contact in person, on the phone, or over e-mail? The way you make contact will depend on the specific selling situation. Consider whether you are in a situation in which you will initiate the approach, whether your customers will initiate the approach, or whether your selling will include a mixture of both. For instance, maybe you work for a company that specializes in corporate training and personal development services, and your customers include referrals (in which case the prospect is approaching you) as well as prospects you have identified through research (in which case you are contacting them). Even retail selling can include a mixture of both. If you are selling cars or fine jewelry for instance, your customer might come into the showroom or store and ask you for help directly, or he might just start looking around, in which case you would approach him. Of course, because of the environment, in most retail situations the approach happens in person.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s03_p02">While there’s not one set way to make an approach, the constant is to make every approach personal. Every situation is different—some approaches may be made at a trade show, while others may be made in an office, or even on the phone—but it’s always a good idea to show appreciation. “In every conversation, include at least one appreciative remark,” according to Rosalie Maggio, best-selling author of <em class="emphasis">How to Say It</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Art of Talking to Anyone</em>. Praise the other person’s business acumen, charity work, or even her taste in shoes. As long as the appreciation is brief, sincere, and specific, the feeling will be remembered long after the words are forgotten.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_011">Robert Jones, “How to Make a Powerful First Impression,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, November 17, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/startingabusiness/selfassessment/article198622.html">http://www.entrepreneur.com/startingabusiness/selfassessment/article198622.html</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s03_p03">On the other hand, in situations where <em class="emphasis">you</em> are generally approaching the customer first, it’s important to think strategically about the way you want to contact your prospects. E-mail is one of the most efficient and least expensive ways to get in touch with a large number of prospects, but e-mail—like direct mail—is impersonal and has a low response rate: 2 or 3 percent at best.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650707">Joanna L. Krotz, “5 Steps to Hitting Your Direct Mail Targets,” Microsoft Small Business Center, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=5+steps+to+hitting+your+direct+mail+targets&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">http://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=5+steps+to+hitting+your+direct+mail+targets&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span> (Just think of all the “junk” e-mails you delete or send through your spam filters on daily basis). E-mail can work as an extension of the qualifying process because only the prospects with genuine interest will be motivated enough to respond. This makes e-mail a useful approach for smaller, less complicated sales that require the seller to deal with a large number of prospects<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650722">Sean Mize, “What’s the Most Effective First Contact with a Prospect—Email or Phone?” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Whats-The-Most-Effective-First-Contact-With-A-Prospect---Email-Or-Phone?&amp;amp;id=1206246">http://ezinearticles.com/?Whats-The-Most-Effective- First-Contact-With-A-Prospect---Email-Or-Phone?&amp;amp;id=1206246</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span> (e.g., insurance or real estate). On the other hand, e-mail is not the most effective way to reach your best prospects, especially not in complicated B2B sales—after all, in relationship selling you want your approach to be as personal as possible.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s03_p04">Face-to-face interaction is definitely the most personal approach you can make, but it is also the most difficult. In large B2B sales, since your contacts are decision makers with high levels of responsibility, they are busy people. You wouldn’t just show up at their businesses without an appointment. In these cases, it’s best to call first and ask your contact if you can schedule a time to meet with her in person. Of course, you might get sent right to voice mail, especially when you are trying to contact a busy manager. If you’ve tried a number of times and can’t get through, you can leave a message, but make sure you follow up by calling back later in the day or the next day. Be persistent and call back until you can speak to someone. Also keep in mind that there are always exceptions to the rule. You might have the opportunity to make a face-to-face first contact (and secure an appointment for a sales presentation) if you know your B2B prospect will be present at a trade show or industry event you plan to attend.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s05_p01">Tailoring your sales approach to the individual customer is one of the keys to relationship selling. Even in retail situations in which the prospect is approaching you first (so you aren’t able to research her beforehand), you would approach different customers differently. Consider the example from <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch07#fwk-125752-ch07">Chapter 7 "Prospecting and Qualifying: The Power to Identify Your Customers"</a> for instance: selling a gym membership to a prospect who walks into your fitness club. If a woman with two young children comes in, you would probably spend time showing her the child care center, and you would discuss any family centered activities your club offered. If she expressed an interest in aerobics or Pilates, you would show her the class schedule and the fitness rooms where the classes are held. Adaptive selling—especially in situations in which you haven’t been able to prepare—involves observation, listening, and asking directed questions to uncover what your prospect needs and cares about.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s05_p02">John Brennan, president of Interpersonal Development, suggests using intuition to customize your behaviors and the substance of your communications to your customers’ buying style. “If [something in the interaction] does not feel right,” he says, “pay attention.” Tune in to your customer’s responses. If you get the sense that he wants simplicity, don’t go into too much detail. On the other hand, if he uses detail in his own responses, use a higher level of complexity when you respond back.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_022">John Brennan, “Adapt Your Style to Win over the Customer,” EvanCarmichael.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/395/Adapt-your-style-to-win-over-the-customer.html">http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/395/Adapt-your-style-to-win-over-the-customer.html</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> Ultimately, the trick is to get inside your customer’s head. Ask yourself, “What would I care about and want to know if I was this person? What would I respond well to?” Is your customer an individual consumer? Is he a technical expert? Is he someone working to earn the respect of higher-level managers in his company? Putting yourself in your customer’s shoes and adapting accordingly will help you earn his trust.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_023">John Brennan, “The Art of Adaptation,” EvanCarmichael.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/395/The-Art-of-Adaptation.html">http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/395/The-Art-of-Adaptation.html</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s01_s02_s05_p03">In 1946, when the American Tobacco Company’s account was up for grabs, big advertising firms across the country competed to earn its business. Ben Duffy, the president of a small advertising firm in New York City, also decided to take a shot at the account. Duffy made a phone call and successfully secured an appointment with the president of the tobacco company, but he knew he was just a small firm up against advertising giants and that he would have to do something to set himself apart during the sales call. As he thought about what to do, Duffy decided to put himself into his prospect’s shoes. “What questions would I have on my mind if I were the president of American Tobacco?” he asked himself. He made a list of fifty questions then narrowed that list down to ten. The next day when he met with his prospect, Duffy said, “I thought you would have some questions about me, my company, what’s in the deal for you, and what’s in it for me, so I made a list.” Surprisingly, the president had also made a list of ten questions, and seven of the ten questions on the two men’s lists were the same. By putting himself in his prospect’s shoes, Duffy established quick rapport and walked out of the office that day with a $15 million advertising account.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_024">See <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bradskiles.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Larry_Wilson.24852250.pdf">http://www.bradskiles.com/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Larry_Wilson.24852250.pdf</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

Of course all sales have a bottom line (you ultimately want to close the sale), but your customer has something he wants out of the transaction, too. In relationship selling you want to focus on your customer so he gets what he wants; when you do this, your selling becomes a collaborative process. When you practice collaborative selling, both you and your customer get more out of the situation, and you create ideas that would not have been possible for each party working individually.</p>

Doug Sterne, Pandora’s director of sales, approached the natural foods retailer about locally targeted advertising spots in the San Francisco Bay Area. He told Whole Foods that one of Pandora’s goals is keeping advertising to a minimum, only airing one commercial per hour of radio time, but that selling advertising is necessary to Pandora’s continued success. Meanwhile he learned from Whole Foods that one of their goals was “for listeners to see Whole Foods as a place where they could get complete meals.” By sharing their objectives this way, the two companies were able to build an advertising campaign that included fifteen-second audio spots targeting listeners within a certain distance of various Whole Foods locations as well as time-specific promotional ads: one in the morning promoting a lunch special and one promoting a fish special closer to the dinner hour. The collaboration resulted in a successful return on investment for both parties, and Whole Foods is planning to expand their advertising purchases to include the Los Angeles area soon.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_025">Andrew Hampp, “Pandora Set to Expand Thanks to New Royalty Ruling,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 13, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=137878">http://adage.com/mediaworks/article?article_id=137878</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s01_s01_p01">There’s nothing more off-putting in a sales approach than a salesperson misspelling or mispronouncing your name. If the salesperson can’t be bothered to learn something as basic as your name, it sends the message that he doesn’t care about you as a person, and it certainly gets the relationship off to a bad start. In e-mails, double check that the customer’s name isn’t misspelled or mistyped. For telephone or in-person approaches make sure you’ve figured out how to pronounce the prospect’s name during your preapproach research. Ask contacts who might know (a receptionist, for instance, or your referral source) if you are unsure. And if the prospect has a difficult name, and you can’t get a confirmation on pronunciation, avoid using his name in your opening lines.</p>

It’s a concise description of a product or service that should take no longer than an average elevator ride.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_030">Aileen Pincus, “The Perfect (Elevator) Pitch,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessWeek</em>, June 18, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2007/ca20070618_134959.htm">http://www.businessweek.com/careers/content/jun2007/ca20070618_134959.htm</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span> Every salesperson has an elevator pitch for the product or service he is selling. That way, he can tell people about his product in under sixty seconds, and it’s a perfect way to start a conversation or phone call and helps to make a good first impression. In fact, everyone from a CEO to an entrepreneur has an elevator pitch about her company to tell potential investors, shareholders, and other stakeholders. Most listeners don’t have the time to hear all the details about a product or service in the first minutes of a conversation so the elevator pitch provides just enough information so the audience knows what he is talking about and wants to know more. In other words, “An elevator pitch is an overview of an idea, product, service, project, person, or other solution and is designed to just get a conversation started.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_031">Chris O’Leary, “Elevator Pitch 101,” January 27, 2009, Elevator Pitch Essentials, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html">http://www.elevatorpitchessentials.com/essays/ElevatorPitch.html</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span></p>

It’s the perfect opportunity to tell someone about your company and product or service in less than sixty seconds so that you can engage her in conversation. Remember, an elevator pitch isn’t a sales presentation; it’s simply a way to begin an interactive conversation and get to your ultimate goal—a meeting with the decision maker.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s02_p01">Establishing rapport can be a challenging task when you make your approach by phone because you can’t read your customer’s body language or other visual cues, and she can’t read yours. There is also the possibility that you will catch your prospect during a busy or inconvenient time. For telephone approaches, it’s best to be brief and direct and to save small talk for your in-person meeting or for a later, scheduled phone call.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s02_s01_p01">Your prospect will probably decide whether or not he is interested in what you have to say within the first twenty seconds of the call, so it’s best to be direct and get this essential information across early on. You might say something like “This is Shamika Lorenz from Selling Solutions, a firm that specializes in helping businesses reduce their selling costs, and I’m calling to let you know about an upcoming seminar for small business owners in your area.” Such directness also conveys honesty and lets your prospect know that you won’t waste his time.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_033">Sharon Drew Morgan, “This is a Sales Call: How to Begin Prospecting Calls with Integrity,” EzineArticles, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?This-is-a-Sales-Call:-How-to-Begin-Prospecting-Calls-with-Integrity&amp;amp;id=34073">http://ezinearticles.com/?This-is-a-Sales-Call:-How-to-Begin-Prospecting-Calls-with-Integrity&amp;amp;id=34073</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_p03">For PJA Advertising &amp; Marketing, entry into the social networking world has transformed the way the company interacts with customers on every level. Phil Johnson, one of PJA’s senior managers, says, “Now our social media activities involve almost everyone who works here and touch almost every aspect of agency life.” Early on, the company’s vice president of business development used LinkedIn to connect with PJA’s prospects and current customers, and today PJA uses LinkedIn in combination with Twitter, Facebook, and links through YouTube and Flickr to approach new customers and direct potential prospects to the company’s Web site. The upshot? According to Johnson, it’s working. The benefit of using social networks to reach prospects is that you can have greater transparency, he says. PJA might contact a prospect via LinkedIn and direct him to a YouTube video, which might then include a link to the company’s Web page or Twitter account, so in the end the prospect gets a view of the agency from a number of sources. “Today, when we walk into a capability meeting, the people we’re talking to already have had a lot of exposure to our thinking and our personality,” says Johnson.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_049">Phil Johnson, “Tweeting Your Way to New Prospects,” <em class="emphasis">Advertising Age</em>, July 6, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://adage.com/smallagency/post?article_id=137730">http://adage.com/smallagency/post?article_id=137730</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s01_p01">According to marketing specialist Leslie Hamp, even something as simple as “I noticed we were on the Webinar together, and I’d like to add you as my friend,” will work.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_050">Leslie Hamp, “5 Steps to Effective Business Social Networking,” Social Networking News, July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> The point is that you want to give your approach a personal touch. If you just go out and friend all your prospects without making the effort to engage with them, they might not accept your friend request in the first place, and even if they do accept, they may wonder who you are and how you found them. Or worse, they may soon forget about you altogether. You can think of the networking tool as a facilitator, something that gives you the opportunity to connect, but it is still up to you to do the work of socially interacting and leveraging your connections.</p>

This means considering ways you can participate in and contribute to the online community, rather than simply using the social networking sites to promote yourself or your product. As virtual office administrator Sue Canfield says, “Social networking needs to be about building relationships—not primarily about self-promotion.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_052">Sue Canfield, “Social Networking Can Work for Your Business,” Chief Virtual Officer, May 12, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://chiefvirtualofficer.com/blog/2009/05/12/social-networking-can-work-for-your-business/">http://chiefvirtualofficer.com/blog/2009/05/12/social-networking-can-work-for-your-business/</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> For instance, if you decide to start participating in a news-related social networking site like Digg.com (where people post links to and comments about news stories), start rating and commenting on other users’ postings before you begin bookmarking your content there.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_053">Sudarmaji Lamiran, “How to Quickly and Easily Leverage Social Media to Build a Big List,” Social Networking News, July 13, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s04_s05_p01">Even though a social-network approach looks different from an in-person or over-the-phone approach, the purpose is the same—establishing rapport, building trust, and helping your customer discover needs and opportunities—so avoid making your sales pitch during your initial contact. For instance, returning to the example of the Web site design specialist, assume you added ten of your fellow Webinar participants to your social network. Maybe your company has made a short YouTube video that offers advice on incorporating blogging capabilities into business Web sites, so you send a message and link to your ten new contacts: “I thought you might be interested in this video.” In the video’s description on YouTube, you can post a link to your company Web site or blog where you make a direct sales pitch. This way you are offering your prospects valuable information without coming across as pushy. If a prospect is interested in pursuing your services, he has the resources to follow up on his own.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_055">Leslie Hamp, “5 Steps to Effective Business Social Networking,” Social Networking News, July 9, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/">http://socialnetworkingnewstoday.com/</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s05_p01">Some managers and buyers are extremely busy, and when you try to reach them by phone, you will only interact with a secretary, so your first contact with your actual customer might be at a trade show or industry event. When John Koss, sales vice president and partial owner of Koss Corp., wants to approach buyers from his megaretail clients, he heads to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Koss Corp. sells headphones and audio equipment to stores around the country, including big names like Wal-Mart, Target, and Sears. Before heading to CES, Koss schedules appointments with some buyers and hopes that others—like Wal-Mart’s buyers, who refuse to make appointments—will stop by his booth. He makes a number of sales approaches at the trade show and then spends the next few months traveling to interested buyers’ corporate headquarters, where he gives his sales presentations.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_056">Susan Greco, “Marketing: Selling the Superstores,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, July, 1995, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/19950701/2331.html">http://www.inc.com/magazine/19950701/2331.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Koss’s strategy is an example of one typical B2B sales approach situation.</p>

Why make an in-person approach rather than placing a phone call? While visiting in person takes more time and effort, it’s more personal: it is often easier to build rapport with your customer during a face-to-face interaction. There are just a few things to keep in mind when making an in-person or telephone approach in B2B sales.</p>

When deciding how to balance small talk with business, it’s important to take your lead from your customer.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s06_p01">In B2C sales situations, there is sometimes a greater temptation to focus immediately on selling and to forget about rapport building. In most B2C situations the salesperson hasn’t invested time in researching the prospect, and he might figure that this is a one-time sale. However, relationship selling is as valuable in the retail environment as it is in the B2B sales environment. Salespeople who treat their customers as <em class="emphasis">people</em> before they treat them as sales prospects are the ones who get good customer referrals and repeat buyers. If you have a restaurant or a coffee shop where you’re a regular customer, you might already know how this principle works. Aren’t you more inclined to order coffee at a place where people greet you, know your name, and get your drink order right—even if another coffee shop opens up closer to your home or your office? Here are a few dos and don’ts when it comes to earning your customer’s trust and building rapport.</p>

You might agree with sales consultant Donna Seigel who says “Frankly, when [the salespeople ignore me], I’m not inclined to ever go into that store again.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_062">Donna Siegel, “Relationship Selling: Getting Your Customers Coming Back for More,” SalesMBA, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.salesmba.com/articles1/ssrl03.htm">http://www.salesmba.com/articles1/ssrl03.htm</a> (accessed July 30, 2009).</span> Engaging your customer might mean the difference between making or losing a sale.

Maybe the customer comes into your computer store looking for printer ink. Rather than leaving him to fend for himself, walk him to the aisle where you keep your printers (don’t just point him in the right direction). Once you take him to the aisle, ask if you can help him find the right ink type for his printer.</p>

Let your customers know that they don’t have to worry about pressure when they buy from you.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s02_s07_p01">You might be thinking at this point, “Fine. Now I know how to establish rapport, but how do I turn the call into a sale?” The transition from the approach into the sales presentation will vary, depending on the selling situation. In a B2B sale, your approach might lead to a face-to-face meeting, which might be an information-gathering session where you learn about the customer’s needs in greater detail, and you might not actually make your sales approach for several months. On the other hand, in some B2C sales, the salesperson might be able to launch into her presentation in less than a minute after meeting the customer. There is no formula that applies; the important thing is to understand the environment in which you are working. Sometimes it makes sense to move directly into a sales presentation, and sometimes it doesn’t.

Once you establish permission, you could ask a closed question (one with a yes or no answer) like “Are you happy with your current copy machines?” but then you risk ending the conversation quickly if your prospect says “yes.” You could ask an open-ended question like “How well do your copiers work?” but this is broad question, and there’s a good chance that you will get a vague answer. Instead, it’s better to ask a leading question that demonstrates you know something about the problems your customer might be facing with her current products.</p>

As John Carroll, CEO of Unlimited Performance, says, “Tapping into strong, existing relationships” accelerates your ability to build new customer relationships.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650782">John Carroll, “Referrals: The Sale’s Professional’s Best Friend,” Unlimited Performance, Inc., 1999, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.uperform.com/articles/art-referrals.htm">http://www.uperform.com/articles/art-referrals.htm</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">referral approach</a><span class="glossdef">Mentioning an existing customer relationship to build credibility and trust at the beginning of your sales call.</span></span><span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-20111019-152338-650797">Michael McGaulley, “Sales Hot Buttons for Capturing the Prospect’s Attention Early in Your First Phone Contact,” How-to-Sell-Your-Better-Mousetrap, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Sales-Hot-Buttons-For-Capturing-the-Prospects-Attention-Early-in-Your-First-Phone-Contact&amp;id=4477676">http://ezinearticles.com/?Sales-Hot-Buttons-For-Capturing-the-Prospects-Attention-Early-in-Your-First-Phone-Contact&amp;id=4477676</a> (accessed August 2, 2009).</span> might go something like this:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s05_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">survey approach</a><span class="glossdef">Opening a sales call with a survey or questionnaire to better determine customer needs and preferences.</span></span> is one that works best in sales that require a complex solution or in sales where the solution is often specifically tailored to customer needs, and the approach ranges in levels of formality depending on the selling situation. For instance, if you go to an upscale spa to have a facial, you might be given a brief, informal survey about your specific skin-care needs before you discuss service packages with the aesthetician. Or if you are in the market for a new home, the real estate agent will most likely ask you questions about your preferences and lifestyle before she even begins to show you listings: “How many bedrooms are you looking for?” “Which neighborhood do you want to live in?” “Is outdoor space important to you?” “How many cars do you have?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s05_p02">On the other hand, in B2B situations or in otherwise more complex B2C sales, the survey process might be more formalized. If you want to purchase an insurance plan, the agent may guide you through a detailed, computer-based survey to find out about your medical or driving history, your family members, your vehicles, or other details that are very specific to you as an individual customer. In another B2B situation (e.g., your firm needs to purchase an integrated software suite with diverse capabilities like timekeeping, payroll, and benefits), the salesperson might give you a detailed questionnaire that will identify your specific needs and ask you to complete it before scheduling a sales presentation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s03_s05_p03">The survey approach has the advantage of being a nonthreatening way to establish your initial contact with the prospect, as you are only asking for information and not discussing services or costs. It allows you to gather information and create a sales presentation that will address the customer’s specific needs and be prepared with the appropriate information or ask other people in the company to attend the sales call. In addition, the survey helps your customer feel like she is receiving special treatment because you are using the information you gather to tailor-make a solution that matches her needs.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_079">Gerald L.

The premium approach is common in retail situations such as cosmetics, wine retail, or specialty food stores where sampling a product can often influence a customer’s decision to buy.

Prospects will sometimes hang up on you or refuse to see you, and others will listen to your sales approach and then tell you that they aren’t interested in what you have to offer. However, if you approach your sales call with confidence and refuse to take rejection personally, then the possibility of rejection doesn’t have to be a barrier to your success. Do you believe in the value of the solution you are selling? Are you doing your best to ensure that your customer gets what he needs and wants? Then you have every reason to be confident.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_081">Wendy Weiss, “Why Are We All so Afraid?” Sales Information, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sales.net63.net/1138.php">http://www.sales.net63.net/1138.php</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> Recognize that it is the <em class="emphasis">fear</em> of failure, more than anything else, that creates a barrier between a salesperson and a successful sale.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Successful selling is all about mastering your attitude, and this is especially true when it comes to facing rejection. Sales coach and author Phil Glosserman puts it this way: “The only person who can reject <em class="emphasis">you</em> as a salesperson is yourself.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_082">Phil Glosserman, “The Fear of Rejection,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> There are all kinds of reasons why a prospect might give you a “no thanks” response, very few of which have to do with you personally. Your prospect might simply be unwilling or unable to make a purchase at the moment, he might be facing pressures at work that prevent him from giving you his full attention, or he might just be having a bad day. Instead of focusing on the way <em class="emphasis">you</em> feel (“What if he turns me down?”), Glosserman suggests focusing on the way your prospect feels (“How can I help him get what he wants out of this interaction?”). If you imagine how your customer feels before and during your interaction, you will often find that you forget to feel anxious.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_083">Phil Glosserman, “The Fear of Rejection,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s01_p02">In addition to mastering your attitude, here are a few empowering and practical things you can do to help build confidence (and get a higher rate of yes responses) going into a sales approach:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Be intentional about the language you use when you approach your prospect; don’t use apologetic language or language that conveys uncertainty. For instance, rather than saying “<em class="emphasis">If</em> you decide to make an appointment,” try a phrasing that conveys greater certainty: “<em class="emphasis">When</em> you make an appointment…” or “After we’ve set up your appointment.…”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_084">Laura Laaman, “Assumptions, Sales Practice Help Fight Fear of Rejection,” <em class="emphasis">Pittsburgh Business Times</em>, February 18, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span>
</li>
            <li>Before going in to your sales call, practice with some role-plays. Even if it feels artificial at first, keep at it, and take the task seriously. If you practice various selling scenarios enough times with a role-playing partner, you will learn what a confident approach sounds like, and you will feel more prepared to handle the real situation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_085">Laura Laaman, “Assumptions, Sales Practice Help Fight Fear of Rejection,” <em class="emphasis">Pittsburgh Business Times</em>, February 18, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span>

            <li>Before going into the call, visualize a successful outcome. Phil Glosserman says to “imagine what you <em class="emphasis">want</em> to feel” during the sales call; think of a situation in your life that made you feel that way and put yourself into that frame of mind.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_088">Phil Glosserman, “The Fear of Rejection,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span>

This is a likely scenario in B2B sales when your prospects are busy executives who don’t have the time to handle every call that comes through their office. If you want to see your prospect, you may have to go through the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gatekeeper</a><span class="glossdef">The secretary or assistant whose job it is to screen calls or “guard” the entrance to an executive’s office.

Salespeople often think of gatekeepers as road blocks—something standing in the way of getting to see the prospect—but if a salesperson treats gatekeepers as obstacles to be overcome, not only is he unlikely to get past them, but he is also missing out on the opportunity to collaborate with people who can be valuable assets to his sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_090">Michael A.

If you are networking, at a job interview, or talking with someone, you might have the time for one or two more sentences, but not much more. The secret to an effective elevator pitch is to intrigue the listener so that he wants to hear more. If your elevator pitch is compelling and brief, the listener will respond by asking a question, and you will get the conversation started.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">When to Use Your Elevator Pitch</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p01">One of the most common uses for an elevator pitch is networking. For example, if you attend a professional event you’ll have the opportunity to meet many new people. And you’ll want to tell each one a little bit about yourself. This is a perfect opportunity to use your elevator pitch; it’s not too long and gives you the perfect way to start a conversation and give the person to whom you are speaking the chance to ask a question. You might even find something or someone in common as a result of the information in your elevator pitch: “You were an intern at Classic Architects? My brother used to work there. His name is Jeremy Slater. Do you know him?”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p02">Another opportunity to use your elevator pitch is in an interview. Although you will need more preparation than simply your elevator pitch for an informational interview or a job interview, you will have a head start on your preparation with a strong elevator pitch. It’s the perfect response to what is commonly the first question that is asked at almost every job interview: “So tell me about yourself.” It’s important to be ready with a clear, concise, and compelling statement. If you think you can wing it, you will probably start your interview off on the wrong foot. On the other hand, a good elevator pitch allows you to direct the conversation to the things you want to talk about (your brand positioning points).</p>

            <p class="simpara">Make Your Elevator Pitch Work for You</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p03">It might be challenging to think about communicating your brand story in only sixty seconds, but don’t forget your objective: you want to get the internship or job. While there’s a long way between your elevator pitch and an internship or job, keep your eye on the prize; always have a call to action as part of your elevator pitch. For example, ask for a business card from everyone with whom you speak or meet. That means that whether you are at a networking event or on a job interview, it’s always appropriate to ask the person for their business card. (You might want to brush up and review the business card etiquette covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch05#fwk-125752-ch05">Chapter 5 "The Power of Effective Communication"</a>.)</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s03_p04">Then, follow-up is key. After you meet someone, follow up with an e-mail or phone call within twenty-four hours (or on the appropriate date after an interview). Tell the person how much you enjoyed meeting her and mention something specific about your conversation. It’s a good idea to include a link to an interesting article or video in your e-mail; that will help you stand out in the person’s mind.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s05_s04_p01">Your elevator pitch is a reflection of you, so when you are creating your elevator pitch, write it down, and then say it out loud in front of a mirror until you are comfortable with it. It’s important to rehearse it so that you are comfortable with communicating this brand message in just a few minutes without rambling or stumbling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_098">Laura Raines, “Making Your Pitch,” <em class="emphasis">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</em>, Jobs, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2007_0225_elevatorsp.html">http://www.ajc.com/hotjobs/content/hotjobs/careercenter/articles/2007_0225_elevatorsp.html</a> (accessed July 26, 2009).</span> But you don’t want to have your elevator pitch down cold; in other words, you want to deliver it with ease and with a natural tone and pacing, as if you were saying it for the first time. It’s hard to get the balance between preparation and spontaneity, which is why it’s a good idea to use your elevator pitch frequently. That way you will be able to feel natural saying it and make adjustments based on how it sounds and feels. And don’t forget to smile!</p>
