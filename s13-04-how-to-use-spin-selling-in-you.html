    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_p01">In 1988, Neil Rackham and his company Huthwaite, Inc., researched more than 35,000 sales calls, observing successful and experienced sales professionals doing what they do best. In the process they disproved a number of popular myths about the selling process, and they developed a sales model of their own, which they called SPIN selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_062">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">The SPIN Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 8; Greg Woodley, “SPIN Selling Is Good,” SellingandPersuasionTechniques.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingandpersuasiontechniques.com/SPIN-selling.html">http://www.sellingandpersuasiontechniques.com/SPIN-selling.html</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> Today sales professionals around the world incorporate the SPIN selling model into their sales process with great success—and if you learn a few simple principles, you can too. The following section describes SPIN selling in a nutshell.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is SPIN Selling?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SPIN</a><span class="glossdef">A customer centered sales model. SPIN stands for the four kinds of questions successful salespeople ask their customers: <strong class="emphasis bold">S</strong>ituation, <strong class="emphasis bold">P</strong>roblem, <strong class="emphasis bold">I</strong>mplication, and <strong class="emphasis bold">N</strong>eed-payoff.</span></span> works from the theory that relationship selling is customer-centric. It requires you to adapt your selling process to your customer, and it delivers personal solutions. To make this work, you have to ask your buyer a lot of questions, let him do most of the talking, and give his responses your full attention.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_p02">In the SPIN model, there are four components of a sales call: opening, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment. SPIN gets its name from the four kinds of questions that take place during the investigation stage: <strong class="emphasis bold">S</strong>ituation, <strong class="emphasis bold">P</strong>roblem, <strong class="emphasis bold">I</strong>mplication, and <strong class="emphasis bold">N</strong>eed-payoff.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_p03">With smaller sales, these four components of the sale (opening, investigating, demonstrating capability, and obtaining commitment) often happen sequentially and in a short period of time; a customer might walk onto your car lot and commit to buying a car from you an hour later. But often in business-to-business (B2B) sales, especially complex ones, you will incorporate SPIN components into a number of the steps in your selling process. For instance, you will do some investigation during your preapproach, and you might make an early presentation in which you open, investigate, and demonstrate capability. Because larger sales take more time, you won’t close the sale at the end of your first presentation, but you might get a commitment from your customer to move the sale forward. SPIN selling is not a rigid, step-by-step model; rather it provides an effective, flexible framework for customer centered selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_063">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">SPIN Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 38.</span></p>

If you guessed benefits, you’re right. SPIN selling is all about customization; when you are demonstrating capability, you want to show your prospect how your solution applies to the needs he has expressed. Listing a product’s advantages demonstrates how that product could be useful to anyone (a generic customer), but you don’t want to treat your buyer like a generic customer. OK, so the car you are selling has an excellent sound system that delivers a superior music-listening experience. But what if your prospect only ever listens to talk radio? If you go on at length about the advantages of the sound system, he won’t be impressed.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s01_s03_p03">Rackham and his team concluded that salespeople who demonstrate capability by presenting benefits (rather than advantages) don’t have to deal with as many objections from their prospects. However, you can only demonstrate benefits successfully if you have asked the right questions to uncover your prospect’s specific needs. This is why the investigation stage is so important. Here are examples of some benefits you might share with your prospect:</p>

In complex sales, on the other hand, fewer than 10 percent of calls have one of these two outcomes. It might take several years before your prospect agrees to purchase your solution, so a sales call that ends without a sale is in no way a failure. In between your first sales call and your prospect’s decision to buy, you will have a number of calls in which you either decide to move the process forward, terminate the process, or continue the process without an advance. Any time your prospect ends a call by agreeing on an action that moves you closer to the final sale, you have experienced a successful outcome.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn10_077">Neil Rackham, <em class="emphasis">SPIN Selling Fieldbook</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1996), 42–43.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch10_s04_s02_p01">In relationship selling, the idea of a sales “presentation” can be misleading. To deliver customized value to your prospect, you have to understand his needs and make sure that you are in agreement with him about a solution he could use. This means the sales presentation is a two-way communication. When you make the effort to listen to your prospect this way and when you work to understand his needs, not only will you close more sales, but you will also build stronger, lasting customer relationships. Your prospect will come to trust you and to rely on you as a problem-solving expert.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">SPIN selling</strong> is a four-step model that relies on the theory that successful selling is customer centered and offers customized solutions to your prospect’s problems.</li>
                <li>There are four steps to a SPIN sales call: <strong class="emphasis bold">opening</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">investigation</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">demonstrating capability</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">obtaining commitment</strong>.</li>
                <li>The <strong class="emphasis bold">opening</strong> stage builds rapport and establishes a buyer centered purpose for your call.</li>
                <li>The <strong class="emphasis bold">investigation</strong> stage is at the heart of the SPIN model. The goal of this stage is to ask questions that will uncover your buyer’s needs.</li>
                <li>There are four types of investigation questions: <strong class="emphasis bold">S</strong>ituation, <strong class="emphasis bold">P</strong>roblem, <strong class="emphasis bold">I</strong>mplication, and <strong class="emphasis bold">N</strong>eed-payoff (SPIN).</li>
                <li>In <strong class="emphasis bold">demonstrating capability</strong>, you explain the benefits of your solution by showing your prospect how your product or service meets his explicit needs.</li>
                <li>In <strong class="emphasis bold">obtaining commitment</strong>, you get your prospect to agree to advance the sale, continue the sale without advancing, or make a purchase.</li>

                <li>Assume you own a business that rents out retail space in a downtown area. You have found out from your prospect, the owner of a bagel shop, that his current store location is on a side street that doesn’t get much foot traffic. List at least one each of the following kinds of questions that may help uncover his unstated needs: situation, problem, implication, and need-payoff. Discuss how these questions would work during the investigation stage of your SPIN selling presentation?</li>
                <li>Envision a selling situation between a travel agency that offers a variety of discount packages for business prospects and a consulting firm whose employees travel frequently for business. As a salesperson for the travel agency, what specific information would you need to know about your prospect’s current situation? How much of this information do you think you could find through research? What specific situation questions would you be likely to ask?</li>
                <li>Your firm offers state-mandated alcohol handler’s training for restaurant employees, and you are making a sales call on a manager who has just opened three large restaurants and will be hiring a staff of over seventy-five servers and bartenders. Your training is more comprehensive than that of your competitors because it includes over five hours of training per employee. Many restaurant companies opt to leave the training up to the individual restaurants, which leads to inconsistency and lack of implementation. Companies may not realize how risky this is; the fine for improper implementation is $10,000 per restaurant. Prepare a presentation that includes the four stages of SPIN selling (opening, investigation, demonstrating capability, and gaining commitment). Include the four types of questions during the investigation stage (situation, problem, implication, and need-payoff).</li>
                <li>Assume you work for Apple in their B2B division and you are selling iPhones to a major medical supply company for their employees, including their five-hundred-person sales force. They are currently not using smartphones but realize they have a need for them for their employees to stay in touch throughout the day and to access the Internet while they are away from the office. The prospect is also considering other brands of smartphones. Create a short sales presentation for the iPhone using the four stages of SPIN selling (opening, investigation, demonstrating capability, and gaining commitment). Include the four types of questions during the investigation stage (situation, problem, implication, and need-payoff).</li>
