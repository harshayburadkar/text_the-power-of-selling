    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s02_p01">So you have a unique idea, the passion and perseverance to bring it to market, and the willingness to take the risk. Now what?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s02_p02">Being an entrepreneur in some ways is like being a student: you have to do your homework. In the business setting, that means creating a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business plan</a><span class="glossdef">A document that details everything about the business from the product position in the marketplace to the financial information for the next three years.</span></span>: a road map of the who, what, when, where, why, and how of your business. A business plan is a document that details everything about the business from the product position in the marketplace to the financial information for the next three years. But a business plan is not simply like a term paper—a project that’s completed and then put on the shelf. A business plan is a dynamic document and should serve four purposes:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch15_s02_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sell you on the business</strong>. While this might sound like a no-brainer, the business plan development process includes rigorous research that can be a good eye-opener about the feasibility of your idea. Ideally, your business plan helps put your idea and its potential into perspective and gives you the details you need to move from concept to reality. However, even if you determine that your idea doesn’t have as much potential as you thought or might cost more than you anticipated, the process of creating a business plan helped you reach that conclusion.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sell others on the business</strong>. In many cases, a business needs some kind of support—financial, consultative, or other resources. In this case, the business plan plays the role of the selling and marketing materials for your idea. How you make your idea come alive and support it with the necessary research and financial data can be the difference between someone becoming a stakeholder in your new venture or taking a pass.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Give you confidence</strong>. Having a great idea is one thing, doing the research to understand exactly what it will take to make the idea real is quite another. Having a better understanding of what it takes to launch and manage the business puts you in control to solicit investors and other supporters and start your journey.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Improve your chances of success</strong>. A business plan is a lot of planning and work, but it’s worth it. According to a study conducted by AT&amp;T, 42 percent of entrepreneurs who had written a business plan rated themselves as more successful than the 58 percent who hadn’t written one.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn15_049">David E.

Whether you plan to fund the business yourself or find an investor to provide some capital (money), you will need your business plan to secure resources from your bank, insurance company, lawyer, attorney, and other support areas. Your business plan is the universal document for discussions with each of these people. In fact, you should first present your business plan to family, friends, and mentors to get some feedback before you take it out “on the road.”</p>
