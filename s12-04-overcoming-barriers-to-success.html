After closing in Philadelphia, he moved to Chicago, then to New Orleans, then to New York, each time failing and starting over again. In fact, it took ten years of rejection and failure before Hershey’s business succeeded. You already know how the story ended for Hershey (now a $5 billion company), but now you also know that the Hershey Chocolate Company wasn’t an overnight success; the business only took off thanks to one salesman’s persistence in the face of failure.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_080">Evan Carmichael, “His Secret Recipe: How Hershey Achieved Success,” video, EvanCarmichael.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/603/His-Secret-Recipe-How-Hershey-Achieved-Success.html">http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/603/His-Secret-Recipe-How-Hershey-Achieved-Success.html</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_p02">Rejection is a reality that all sales professionals have to deal with occasionally, no matter how experienced or skilled they are; it comes with the territory. Prospects will sometimes hang up on you or refuse to see you, and others will listen to your sales approach and then tell you that they aren’t interested in what you have to offer. However, if you approach your sales call with confidence and refuse to take rejection personally, then the possibility of rejection doesn’t have to be a barrier to your success. Do you believe in the value of the solution you are selling? Are you doing your best to ensure that your customer gets what he needs and wants? Then you have every reason to be confident.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_081">Wendy Weiss, “Why Are We All so Afraid?” Sales Information, 2004, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sales.net63.net/1138.php">http://www.sales.net63.net/1138.php</a> (accessed August 1, 2009).</span> Recognize that it is the <em class="emphasis">fear</em> of failure, more than anything else, that creates a barrier between a salesperson and a successful sale.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s01_p01">Successful selling is all about mastering your attitude, and this is especially true when it comes to facing rejection. Sales coach and author Phil Glosserman puts it this way: “The only person who can reject <em class="emphasis">you</em> as a salesperson is yourself.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_082">Phil Glosserman, “The Fear of Rejection,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span> There are all kinds of reasons why a prospect might give you a “no thanks” response, very few of which have to do with you personally. Your prospect might simply be unwilling or unable to make a purchase at the moment, he might be facing pressures at work that prevent him from giving you his full attention, or he might just be having a bad day. Instead of focusing on the way <em class="emphasis">you</em> feel (“What if he turns me down?”), Glosserman suggests focusing on the way your prospect feels (“How can I help him get what he wants out of this interaction?”). If you imagine how your customer feels before and during your interaction, you will often find that you forget to feel anxious.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_083">Phil Glosserman, “The Fear of Rejection,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s01_p02">In addition to mastering your attitude, here are a few empowering and practical things you can do to help build confidence (and get a higher rate of yes responses) going into a sales approach:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Be intentional about the language you use when you approach your prospect; don’t use apologetic language or language that conveys uncertainty. For instance, rather than saying “<em class="emphasis">If</em> you decide to make an appointment,” try a phrasing that conveys greater certainty: “<em class="emphasis">When</em> you make an appointment…” or “After we’ve set up your appointment.…”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_084">Laura Laaman, “Assumptions, Sales Practice Help Fight Fear of Rejection,” <em class="emphasis">Pittsburgh Business Times</em>, February 18, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span>
</li>
            <li>Before going in to your sales call, practice with some role-plays. Even if it feels artificial at first, keep at it, and take the task seriously. If you practice various selling scenarios enough times with a role-playing partner, you will learn what a confident approach sounds like, and you will feel more prepared to handle the real situation.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_085">Laura Laaman, “Assumptions, Sales Practice Help Fight Fear of Rejection,” <em class="emphasis">Pittsburgh Business Times</em>, February 18, 2005, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2005/02/21/smallb2.html</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span>
</li>
            <li>Don’t procrastinate. “The longer you procrastinate about something, the larger it becomes in your mind,”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_086">BNET Reference Publications, “Facing the Fear of Rejection—Emotional Problem that Can be Devastating to the Success of Sales Representatives,” BNET, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_n2623_v125/ai_19313504">http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1272/is_n2623_v125/ai_19313504</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span> so don’t put off a sales call because of nerves. Facing your fears is the best way to overcome them.</li>
            <li>Make difficult calls when you have the most energy. This is usually the start of the business day.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_087">“Tips for Successful Cold Calling,” AllBusiness, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-telesales/1355-1.html">http://www.AllBusiness.com/sales/selling-techniques-telesales/1355-1.html</a> (accessed August 3, 2009).</span> Morning sales calls can also be a good time to reach busy prospects before the business day gets into full swing.</li>
            <li>Before going into the call, visualize a successful outcome. Phil Glosserman says to “imagine what you <em class="emphasis">want</em> to feel” during the sales call; think of a situation in your life that made you feel that way and put yourself into that frame of mind.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_088">Phil Glosserman, “The Fear of Rejection,” video, <em class="emphasis">Selling Power</em>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009">http://www.sellingpower.com/content/video/?date=7/9/2009</a> (accessed March 16, 2010).</span>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s02_p01">So what do you do if you’ve prepared your opening statement and done your research, but when you make your phone call, it isn’t your prospect who picks up the phone; instead, it’s her assistant, who wants to know who you are, why you are calling, and why you think your prospect should want to talk to you anyway? This is a likely scenario in B2B sales when your prospects are busy executives who don’t have the time to handle every call that comes through their office. If you want to see your prospect, you may have to go through the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gatekeeper</a><span class="glossdef">The secretary or assistant whose job it is to screen calls or “guard” the entrance to an executive’s office.

Salespeople often think of gatekeepers as road blocks—something standing in the way of getting to see the prospect—but if a salesperson treats gatekeepers as obstacles to be overcome, not only is he unlikely to get past them, but he is also missing out on the opportunity to collaborate with people who can be valuable assets to his sale.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_090">Michael A. Boylan, <em class="emphasis">The Power to Get In</em> (New York: St. Martin’s Griffin, 1998), 125.</span> Gatekeepers are human beings (not obstacles) whose jobs are important to the successful running of their organizations. Think of them as part of the selling relationship and treat them with the courtesy and respect with which you would treat your prospect.

She was abrupt with the gatekeeper, so the gatekeeper was abrupt in return. When talking to gatekeepers, give them the information they ask for when they want it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_093">Michael A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch09_s04_s02_p08">Learn the gatekeeper’s name and be friendly. Business writer Susan Ward suggests starting off the conversation by asking “I wonder if you could help me?” as a way to show respect and demonstrate that you see the gatekeeper as part of your selling relationship.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn09_094">Susan Ward, “Cold Calling Tips,” About.com, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/marketing/a/coldcall.htm">http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/marketing/a/coldcall.htm</a> (accessed May 16, 2010).</span> If you do this, you won’t <em class="emphasis">need</em> to get past the gatekeeper; he can often tell you everything you need to know—the name of the right person to talk to or the best time to contact your prospect—or even schedule a meeting for you before you ever interact with your prospect. Finally, when the gatekeeper does give you helpful information, remember to thank her. For extra helpful gatekeepers, you might even consider sending a note or small thank-you gift.</p>
