        <h2 class="title editable block">Getting Started</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Some people know exactly what they want to do in life. Madonna, Venus and Serena Williams, Steve Jobs, and countless others have been preparing for their chosen careers since they were young. Dylan Lauren, daughter of designer Ralph Lauren and chief executive of Dylan’s Candy Bar, could see her path even when she was young. With a father who was a fashion designer and her mother a photographer, she said, “I always knew I wanted to be a leader and do something creative as a career.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn01_030">Patricia R. Olsen, “Sweets Tester in Chief,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, June 7, 2009, business section, 9.</span> Katy Thorbahn, senior vice president and general manager at Razorfish, one of the largest interactive marketing and advertising agencies in the world, always knew she wanted to be in advertising. Her father was in advertising, her uncle was in advertising, and she had an internship at an advertising agency, so it was no surprise that she pursued a career in advertising. You probably know some people like this. They know exactly the direction they want to take and how they want to get there.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_p02">It’s not that way for everyone, however. In fact, most people don’t really know what they want to do for a career or even what types of jobs are available. Whether you are currently working at a job or you are just beginning to determine your career direction, it’s never too early or too late to learn about what career might be a good fit for you. It’s a good idea to use the three steps outlined below to help you begin your career search. These steps can be most effective if you complete them even before you put together your résumé (you’ll get the tools to create your résumé and cover letter in <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a>).</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Explore the Possibilities</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p01">Whether you know your direction or are trying to figure out what you want to do “when you grow up,” there are some excellent tools available to you. The best place to start is at your campus career center. (If your school does not have a career center, visit the library.) The people who work there are trained professionals with working knowledge of the challenges to overcome, as well as the resources needed to conduct a career search. People find that visiting the career center in person to meet the staff is a great way to learn firsthand about what is available. Also, most campus career centers have a Web site that includes valuable information and job postings.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p02">At this stage in your career search, you might consider taking a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">career assessment survey</a><span class="glossdef">A tool to determine which jobs might be the best fit for your skills, strengths, and experience.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">skills inventory</a><span class="glossdef">A survey or questionnaire that helps identify your level of skills, strengths, and weaknesses to help determine what job or industry you might consider pursuing.</span></span>, and/or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">aptitude test</a><span class="glossdef">A test to determine your interest, skills, and abilities.</span></span>. If you’re unsure about your direction, these tools can help you discover exactly what you like (and don’t like) to do and which industries and positions might be best for you. In addition, there are many resources that provide information about industries, position descriptions, required training and education, job prospects, and more. These are especially helpful in learning about position descriptions and job opportunities within a specific industry.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s01_p03">Here are some resources that you may find to be a good place to begin a search. Most of the Web sites listed provide surveys exercises and information at no charge.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p01">You might be thinking that you just want to get a simple job; you don’t need an elaborate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal mission statement</a><span class="glossdef">A brief but broad statement of who you are and what you want to accomplish.</span></span>. Although you may not be asked about your personal mission statement during an interview, it is nonetheless important, because it provides you with a concrete sense of direction and purpose, summarized in relatable words. Great brands have clear, concise mission statements to help the company chart its path. For example, Google’s mission statement is “To organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn01_031">Google, “Corporate Information, Company Overview,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/</a> (accessed June 6, 2009).</span> The mission statement for Starbucks is “To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn01_032">Starbucks, “Our Starbucks Mission,” <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.starbucks.com/mission/default.asp">http://www.starbucks.com/mission/default.asp</a> (accessed June 6, 2009).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p02">It’s worth your time to write a personal mission statement. You might be surprised to discover that people who have a personal mission statement find it easier to get an enjoyable job. This is precisely because a personal mission statement helps provide framework for what’s important to you and what you want to do and accomplish.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s02_p03">A mission statement is a concise statement about what you want to achieve—the more direct, the better. It should be short (so don’t worry about wordsmithing) and easy to recall (you should always know what your mission statement is and how to measure your activities against it). A mission statement should be broad in nature. In other words, it doesn’t specifically state a job you want. Instead, it describes who you are, what you stand for, what you want to do, and the direction you want to take.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn01_033">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p01">Choosing a career direction and writing a personal mission statement are not things that can be done in one day. They require research, evaluation, consideration, and a lot of soul searching. The same is true for defining your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">personal brand</a><span class="glossdef">The characteristics that define you and what you have to offer to a prospective employer.</span></span>.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p02">You’ve learned about the power of a brand in the selling process and that a brand can be a product, service, concept, cause, or even a person. Truly, the most important product, brand, or idea you will ever sell is yourself.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn01_035">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 1.</span> You’re not just a person, you’re a brand. When you begin your job search, you will need to sell yourself to prospective employers. When you sell yourself effectively, you will be able to sell your ideas, your value, your experience, and your skills to get the job you want.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p03">It’s easy to talk about brands. It’s harder to define one, especially when the brand is <em class="emphasis">you</em>. Many people feel uncomfortable talking about themselves. Others feel as if they are bragging if they are forced to put themselves in a positive light. The fact of the matter is, to be successful and stand apart from the competition, you have to know yourself and carefully craft your brand story.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn01_036">Peggy Klaus, <em class="emphasis">Brag: How to Toot Your Own Horn without Blowing It</em> (New York: Warner Books, Inc., 2003), 3.</span> For the purposes of finding a career, it is important to carefully consider what you believe defines you—what makes you unique, consistent, and relevant—and how to tell your brand story to create an emotional connection with prospective employers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p04">Here’s a strategy to help you think about defining your personal brand. If you were on a job interview and the interviewer asked you, “Tell me three things about yourself that make you unique and would bring value to my company,” what would you say? Would you be able to quickly identify three points that define you and then demonstrate what you mean?</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p05">Many students might answer this question by saying, “I’m hardworking, I’m determined, and I’m good with people.” Although those are good characteristics, they are too generic and don’t really define you as a brand. The best way to tell your brand story is to use the characteristics of a brand covered earlier in this chapter—unique, consistent, and relevant and creating an emotional connection with its customers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p06">If you identify three “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand points</a><span class="glossdef">Specific characteristics that define your personal brand. They are platforms that you can use to demonstrate your skills and experience.</span></span>” you can tell a much more powerful brand story. Brand points are like platforms that you can use to demonstrate your skills and experience. Here are some examples of powerful brand points:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Leadership skills</strong>. This provides a platform to describe your roles in leadership positions at school, work, professional, or volunteer or community service organizations.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Academic achievement</strong>. This provides a platform to highlight your scholarships, awards, honors (e.g., dean’s list), and more. A prospective employer wants to hire the best and the brightest (if academic achievement isn’t your strong suit, don’t use this as one of your brand points).</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Sales (or other) experience</strong>. This provides a platform to underscore your contributions and accomplishments in your current and past positions. Past achievements are the best predictor of future success for a prospective employer so you can focus on results that you have delivered.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch01_s03_s01_s03_p07">You can you see how specific brand points can make a big difference in how you might answer the question above; they help define your brand as being unique (no one else has this combination of education, skills, and experience), consistent (each one demonstrates that you are constantly striving to achieve more), and relevant (prospective employers want people who have these characteristics). Finally, the ability to communicate your brand story in a cover letter, a résumé, and an interview will help you establish an emotional connection with your prospective employer because he or she will be able to identify with components of your personality.</p>
