    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_p02">Sales is a challenging, exhilarating, demanding, and rewarding profession. You want to be successful and enjoy what you do, but you really haven’t had a chance to focus on the actual job between graduation and job interviews. Here’s your chance to look ahead to how you learn the day-to-day activities that go on in the profession of selling, identify the resources to help you be a partner to your customers, and bring success to yourself and your company. It sounds like a tall order, but it’s easy when you have people to guide and support you.</p>

You don’t have to be a celebrity or a person who went to Harvard, according to blogger Auren Hoffman in her April 2009 post “The A-Player Janitor”: “An ‘A-Player’ by definition is incredibly productive and smart and has that ‘it,’ that rockstar-esque factor that makes everyone want to work with her.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_001">Valeria Maltoni, “How Do You Become an A-Player?” Social Media Today, April 17, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/85675">http://www.socialmediatoday.com/SMC/85675</a> (accessed September 4, 2009).</span> Her point is that hiring managers want to hire the best person for every job.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_p01">“The best part of a career in sales is that it is undefined,” according to Ann Devine in a recent article on The Black Collegian Online.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_003">Ann Devine, “Is a Career in Sales Right for You?” The Black Collegian, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.black-collegian.com/career/career-reports/sales-grad05.shtml">http://www.black-collegian.com/career/career-reports/sales-grad05.shtml</a> (accessed August 19, 2009).</span> Every day is completely different; some days you will be researching leads, and other days you might be making a presentation to a prospective customer. This exciting, unstructured, and sometimes unpredictable environment rarely gets boring. But it’s this lack of structure that can present a challenge in choosing priorities and accomplishing goals. Those who are successful realize how to manage themselves and their time and use the resources that are available to them from their company, their colleagues, and their community.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_p02">You might be wondering what managing yourself means. When you are in sales, one of the most important jobs you have is being sure that you have clear direction about what you want to accomplish and what you need to do to get there. Even though you are used to managing yourself and your time at school, it can be a daunting task to be responsible for calling on customers and generating sales, especially if you are based in a location remote from the company office such as your home office. So first things first—identify your resources. Even though you’re traveling solo, you are not alone.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s01_p01">One of the best ways to learn the ropes and get the inside track is to go on ride-alongs (also referred to as shadowing) with colleagues, traveling with an experienced sales rep or sales manager to make sales calls. The video ride-alongs at the start of each chapter are a virtual way for you to get some powerful insights from experienced sales professionals. Sometimes a ride-along is included in the interviewing process; it’s an opportunity for you to experience firsthand exactly what the job entails and for the company to see how you react in the selling environment before you get a job offer. Other times a ride-along is an training opportunity that takes place after you’ve been hired. Either way, always take advantage of as many opportunities as you can to ride-along with experienced salespeople. There are some tips that will help maximize your ride-along experience.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Always be professional</strong>. It is likely that you will be traveling with a salesperson or sales manager at least for a day and sometimes for a week or longer. Even though you will get to know each other, always remember your role on the ride-along.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Avoid highly personal or inappropriate topics</strong>. While it’s always appropriate to tell the truth, it’s best to avoid controversial topics, especially as they relate to the company.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Mind your manners and avoid alcohol if you go out to lunch or dinner</strong>. Since you will ultimately be in the role of entertaining clients, the person with whom you are riding will undoubtedly be watching your social behavior.</li>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Use Your Sales Manager</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p01">Many salespeople don’t realize that their <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sales manager</a><span class="glossdef">Person to whom a salesperson reports and who is accountable for delivering on sales goals.</span></span> (i.e., the person to whom they report) is ultimately responsible for delivering the company’s sales goals. As such, the sales manager wants to do everything he can to help his salespeople be successful. Even before you start your job, it’s a good idea to touch base with your sales manager. Chances are you interviewed with him, so you probably have his contact information. A good way to get off to a great start is to send him a handwritten thank-you note after you’ve accepted the position. What better way to start a new relationship than with a personal note.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p02">Your sales manager can be your most important source of company information as well as customer insights. He had a lot of experience selling before he became a sales manager, and he would likely share his insights to help you be successful. Not only can he make your job (and your life) easier, he can teach you a lot about selling. It’s always a good idea to keep your sales manager updated with the status of your customers and prospects. He will appreciate your proactive and regular updates about the standing of each lead and customer in addition to your regular one-on-one meetings, staff meetings, or conference calls.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p03">Sometimes new salespeople are nervous about asking questions of their sales managers, which is natural. It’s best to remember that your sales manager doesn’t expect you to know everything. Your questions show him that you are interested in learning more about the business from him and help him identify what areas would be most beneficial for coaching. Your sales manager can be a part of your success story. Ask questions, ask his opinion, keep him in the loop, help make him look good, and you will have a relationship that works and grows.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p04">Just as communication is important with customers, it is critical to building your relationship with your sales manager. He probably has a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">span of control</a><span class="glossdef">The number of people that report to one manager.</span></span>, or the number of people reporting to him, ranging from a two to twenty or more people. It’s important to understand the organizational structure of a sales department. While each company is different, the basic structure of a selling organization is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_f01">Figure 14.2 "Sales Department Organization Chart"</a>. In some companies, salespeople may be responsible for a city or cities, region, or other geographic area. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">territory management</a><span class="glossdef">Organizational strategy whereby salespeople are responsible for a designated geographic area such as a city or cites, state, or region.</span></span>. In this case, salespeople, usually called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">territory managers</a><span class="glossdef">Salesperson that is reponsible for the customers in a designated geographic area.</span></span>, are responsible for the customers in their specific geographic area. This organizational strategy helps minimize the amount of travel time between customers.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s02_p05">In other companies, salespeople may be responsible for specific brands, products, or product categories. In the case of food manufacturers, these categories might be noncarbonated beverages, prepared meals, or dairy products. In the professional services arena, the organization might be vertical, such as retail sales, financial services, or health care. This product or category approach may require salespeople to travel to customers in various parts of the country based on the needs of the customers. It requires the salesperson to develop expertise in a specific product or discipline. These sales positions may have titles such as account manager, product manager, or sales rep. The different types of sales positions are discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch02#fwk-125752-ch02">Chapter 2 "The Power to Choose Your Path: Careers in Sales"</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Resources and Resourcefulness</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s03_p01">The company you work for, whether it is large or small, has resources. A laptop, the customer relationship management (CRM) system, your expense account, the company owner, the human resources department, accounts receivable department, and others are all resources that can help you do your job. Take the time to explore all the resources when you start with the company. In larger companies, you will most likely participate in an orientation session or process frequently referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">onboarding</a><span class="glossdef">Employee orientation process or method for a new employee to learn about company practices, policies, and procedures.</span></span> to learn about how the company operates and how your can take advantage of resources to help you do your job. In a small company, the process is less formal and requires you to be more proactive about understanding what’s available. Either way, it’s your responsibility to explore and understand your resources. Remember that all the skills you use when you are communicating with customers are the same when you are communicating inside your company: build lasting relationships that are mutually beneficial. While every company is different, here are some internal resources that are available in most companies.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s02_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Human resources department</strong>. Whether you work for a large company or a start-up, it’s a good idea to know the key people in HR. Chances are, you interviewed with someone in the department, but don’t stop there. Continue your relationship by learning who handles employee relations (for questions about the company policies or an ethical dilemma) and who handles benefits (for questions about medical, dental, other insurance, 401(k) plan, and other company benefits).</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Finance department</strong>. You’ll want to get to know the people who handle accounts receivable. Since most salespeople are responsible for collections, you will most likely be working closely with people in finance, accounting, or accounts payable. They can provide helpful information about company processes and policies for payment of invoices. You’re not the first person to be challenged by customer payment issues, so take advantage of their knowledge and experience.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Procurement or product development department</strong>. Whether you are selling a product or a service, you will want to know those who make the decisions about exactly what will be available for sale. Customers may have specific questions about the performance of the product or service that you may need some additional information to answer. In addition, building a relationship with people in this department will help give you insight into what will be available in the future. More important, it will help you provide input and feedback based on the customer’s perspective.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Marketing department</strong>. The people who are responsible for getting the word out about your company’s brand are important to know. You can get insights about advertising, promotions, and other communication activities. You can also get important information about future plans and help shape the marketing plan for the future based on your experience with customers.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Information technology department</strong>. Everything from your laptop to your reports is supported in the IT department. It’s especially important to get to know the people who man the help desk. Chances are, you will have a technology emergency at some point in time so it’s best to build a strong relationship from the start.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other salespeople</strong>. Create relationships with the best-performing salespeople so you can learn the best practices. Go on ride-alongs and learn what makes them successful.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Other resources</strong>. Explore the CRM system and company intranet, especially the online communities. This is an excellent way to learn about how sales were won, see examples of successful proposals, and learn about best practices of the top performers.</li>

Knight used comic books as his inspiration and got employees involved in telling the Hard Rock Café story; all the illustrations and photos in the handbook were done by Hard Rock employees.

But they were resourceful about getting people to try their new service, use it, and engage with it. While you might not invent the next Twitter, you can certainly sell the next big idea by using your resources and being resourceful.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p01">Depending on the type of business you are in and the company you work for, you might have as few as one customer and as many as a hundred or more. You might be wondering how you determine which customers to call on each day, how much time should be spent on prospecting versus calling on existing customers, how much time should be devoted to nonselling activities such as travel, paperwork, and internal meetings. While there is no hard-and-fast answer to these questions, your goal should be to spend as much time as possible with customers or prospects. It’s impossible to sell if you are not in front of a customer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p02">Consider this: Salespeople spend approximately fourteen hours a week engaged in face-to-face selling. That means that 70 percent of the time, in an average forty-six-hour workweek, salespeople are doing something other than face-to-face selling.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_009">Gerald L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p03">Since your objective is to spend as much time as possible with customers, you’ll need to balance where you physically spend your time and with which customers you spend it. This is where territory management strategies come into play. Based on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">call cycle</a><span class="glossdef">The frequency at which you call on each of your customers (e.g., once every twenty days).</span></span>, the frequency at which you call on each of your customers, and where each is located, you’ll develop a plan to call on your existing customers and allow time for prospecting. In other words, you will need to have a plan to invest your time wisely to meet your goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p04">To plan your sales calls, you’ll need a map (Google maps or MapQuest) and sales and potential sales information by customer (your company CRM system should include some, if not all, of this information), and your call cycle. Identify the location of each of your customers with a red dot or push pin. Then, divide your territory into sections by geography (designated as one, two, three, etc.), this can become the basis of your territory management plan. Review your customer data, including current sales and potential sales, to organize and prioritize your customers and calls. <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_f02">Figure 14.4 "Territory Management Worksheet"</a> includes an example of a territory management worksheet.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s03_p05">Based on this, you would plan your route so that you are making calls in one section of your territory on a given day, then covering another section on another day. This will ensure that you regularly visit your best customers and those with the most potential for growth, minimizing your travel time. While this might seem like a lot of work to do, it will save you time in the long run and help you increase your sales…and your income.</p>

Salespeople get paid on results, not on the number of hours worked. As a salesperson, there are so many demands on your time: client needs, internal meetings, follow-ups, proposals, phone calls, e-mails, text messages, and the emergency du jour. All these can be time thieves, or activities that literally steal your time away from selling. You can easily fill your days with demanding tasks like these that really do not bring value to customers or ultimately close sales. Keep in mind that according to renowned sales consultant and motivational speaker Zig Ziglar, “Nothing happens until someone sells something.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_011">Ann Devine, “Is a Career in Sales Right for You?” The Black Collegian, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.black-collegian.com/career/career-reports/sales-grad05.shtml">http://www.black-collegian.com/career/career-reports/sales-grad05.shtml</a> (accessed August 19, 2009).</span> To understand how to avoid getting caught up in the daily sea of details, it’s a good idea to realize why these interruptions and administrative demands consume your day. Here are three key reasons that time can get away from you:</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Poor planning</strong>. Avoid getting caught up in the moment and make a plan every day of selling activities—not time-fillers—that you want to accomplish. True selling activities include things like identifying six new prospects, setting up three appointments for the coming week, or closing at least one sale. “Write your top three outcomes at the top of your plan” is good advice.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_012">John Hacking, “Time Management for Sales People,” Buzzle.com, October 15, 2007, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.buzzle.com/articles/time-management-for-sales-people.html">http://www.buzzle.com/articles/time-management-for-sales-people.html</a> (accessed September 5, 2009).</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Procrastination</strong>. Fear of rejection causes many salespeople to stay involved in meaningless tasks. It’s hard to get an appointment with a customer, as they don’t always have time to give to salespeople. Customers want true solutions, not a sales pitch. It takes time, research, and creativity to really understand a customers’ business.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn14_013">“Procrastination Costing Your Sales Team,” ArticlesBase, April 29, 2009, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.articlesbase.com/education-articles/procrastination-costing-your-sales-team-893170.html">http://www.articlesbase.com/education-articles/procrastination-costing-your-sales-team-893170.html</a> (accessed September 5, 2009).</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Making tasks too big</strong>. Thinking about how long it takes to go from identifying a prospect to actually closing a sale can sometimes make the job seem overwhelming.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p01">Now you can see why managing yourself, managing your time, and understanding compensation plans are so important to success in sales. All these elements are linked to the company’s goals, which ultimately determine your sales goals. For example, if the company is planning a 6 percent sales increase for the year, each salesperson is responsible for delivering a certain portion of that increase. Since some salespeople are new, their goals will undoubtedly be less than those salespeople who have been at the company long enough to develop customer relationships and steady income streams.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p02">The most important aspect of sales is to understand your sales goals: exactly what is expected and by when. Most companies establish annual sales goals or quotas, expectations of sales for a specific time frame, by salesperson, and then break down the goals by month and sometimes by week. Establishing specific, measurable, actionable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) sales goals (covered in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch08#fwk-125752-ch08">Chapter 8 "The Preapproach: The Power of Preparation"</a>) provides a clear set of expectations for the salesperson and the company. For example, a SMART sales goal is “to increase dollar sales of accounting software with current customers by 8 percent by December 31, 2011.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p03">When this goal is broken down by month and by week, it provides a way to measure progress regularly. More important, the SMART goal provides a method by which to have a regular conversation with your sales manager to discuss how to remove barriers or gain access to additional resources to achieve the goal. SMART goals become the basis of sales quotas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p04">Since many business-to-business (B2B) sales have a long sales cycle, many companies use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">key performance indicators (KPIs)</a><span class="glossdef">Measures of productivity that relate to achieving goals.</span></span> to help gauge the productivity of each salesperson. KPIs might be compared to miles per gallon; they are a measure of efficiency and effectiveness. So while sales or gross profit might be included in a SMART goal, KPIs provide insights into performance; they can act as a way to diagnose problems in the selling process. KPIs are used to evaluate performance and compensation. Results are how salespeople are evaluated and paid. If a salesperson is not generating the desired results, chances are he won’t last long in his position at that company.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch14_s01_s07_p05">KPIs may be organized by type of goal—performance KPIs or conversion KPIs. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Performance KPIs</a><span class="glossdef">Measures of productivity that include outcomes, such as sales, new accounts, units sold, or gross profit percent.</span></span> are those that include outcomes such as sales, new accounts, units sold, or gross profit percent. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conversion KPIs</a><span class="glossdef">Measure of a salesperson’s productivity or efficiency that do not have outcomes, such as sales per customer or closing ratio.</span></span> are used as a measure of a salesperson’s productivity or efficiency but do not have outcomes.
