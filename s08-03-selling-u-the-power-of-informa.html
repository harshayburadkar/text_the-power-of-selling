    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_p01">“Find someone who does what you want to do, then go talk to them.” That’s the advice that Ike Richman, vice president of public relations at Comcast-Spectacor consistently tells students when he is a guest speaker. That is the essence of what an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">informational interview</a><span class="glossdef">A meeting with a professional to learn more about pursuing a career in a specific industry, profession, or job.</span></span> is: one-on-one communication that helps you learn about different industries and potential careers. You learned about the power of networking in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section of <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch03#fwk-125752-ch03">Chapter 3 "The Power of Building Relationships: Putting Adaptive Selling to Work"</a>. And informational interviews are one of the best ways to network. They are the ultimate in business communication because you are “trying on jobs for size to see if they fit you,” according to Richard Nelson Bolles, author of <em class="emphasis">What Color Is Your Parachute?</em> and the person who coined the term “informational interview.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_085">“Informational Interviewing Tutorial: Background Information about Informational Interviews,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is an Informational Interview?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s01_p01">An informational interview is exactly what it sounds like; it’s an opportunity to learn about a particular profession, industry, or job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_086">“Informational Interviewing Tutorial: Background Information about Informational Interviews,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/information_background.html</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span> That means that if you are interested in sales, you might meet with an account manager for a software company and talk to her about what it’s like to be in sales. Or, if you think you want to pursue a job in advertising, you could meet with someone who works at an advertising agency. This gives you the chance to learn the inside story about what it takes to start a career and work in your target industry.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s01_p02">You’ve probably learned about several different professions in your classes; you most likely heard from guest speakers. And through your networking activities, chances are you’ve met people who do what you think you want to do. But it’s impossible to know exactly what career you want to pursue without getting some one-on-one information. What does the job entail? Will you be working with people out in the field or sitting at a desk? What kinds of opportunities are available for personal development? What kind of skills and experience do you need? Is this really a career you will enjoy? What’s the best part of the job? What’s the worst part of the job? All these are excellent questions to ask during an informational interview.

In fact, you can gain knowledge through informational interviews that you might not be able to gain in any other way. It’s important to note that informational interviews are <em class="emphasis">not</em> the place to look for an internship or job.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_087">“Informational Interviewing Tutorial: Never Ask for a Job,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/information_job.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/information_job.html</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span> A job or an internship could result from an informational interview because it is a time to make an impression on someone, demonstrate your skills, and network. However, it’s best to keep in mind that when you ask for an informational interview, you are asking for someone to take the time to share insights and information with you. If you ask the interviewer for a job, you misled the interviewer about the purpose of the meeting.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_088">“Informational Interviewing Tutorial: Never Ask for a Job,” Quintessential Careers, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quintcareers.com/information_job.html">http://www.quintcareers.com/information_job.html</a> (accessed July 12, 2009).</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s03_p01">Informational interviews are usually twenty to thirty minutes long and can take place in person or by phone. Once you identify the people with whom you would like to have an informational interview, it’s time to contact each person and ask for a meeting. It’s always best to request an informational interview in person because you have the opportunity to communicate verbally as well as nonverbally. Although it’s appropriate to send a letter or e-mail to request an informational interview, it’s best to call each person to request the interview or talk to him or her in person. If you use your communication skills, a personal conversation will be much more persuasive than a passive e-mail or letter, which could easily go unanswered.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s03_p02">A telephone conversation should include an introduction along with the reason you are calling. Be clear that you are seeking information; don’t frame your request as a veiled strategy for a job offer. If you are honest about learning about the industry, most people will take the time to help you. You might consider a telephone conversation like this:</p>

That means doing research on the industry, company, and person before you arrive. Visit the company’s Web site as well as those of competitors, research the industry on databases such as Hoovers.com, and do a search on Google to learn more about the person with whom you are interviewing. Also, look her up on LinkedIn, Plaxo.com, Ryze.com, or other professional social networking Web sites to learn more about her professional background before your meeting.</p>

See the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch06#fwk-125752-ch06">Chapter 6 "Why and How People Buy: The Power of Understanding the Customer"</a> for some tips about how to put together a portfolio that helps you show and sell yourself. If you have had an internship, bring clean samples of any projects you worked on; the same is true for any student organizations, volunteer work, or community service that you have done. You should also include a few key class projects to demonstrate your versatility.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p05">Now prepare for the questions. Unlike a regular job interview, you have requested this meeting so you should be prepared to ask the questions. Keep the questions focused on learning about how your interviewer broke into the business and what he can share as a result of his experience. Here are some questions you might consider:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_l01">
                <li>How did you decide to go into this field?</li>
                <li>What was your first job?</li>
                <li>How did you get to your current position?</li>
                <li>What was your favorite job?</li>
                <li>What is the best thing about your current job?</li>
                <li>What is your least favorite part of your job?</li>
                <li>What is the single most important attribute someone needs to have to be successful in this industry?</li>
                <li>What is the typical salary range for an entry-level job in this industry?</li>
                <li>What advice would you give to someone starting out in the industry?</li>
                <li>What is the outlook for the industry?<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn05_098">“Informational Interview Questions,” Career Choice Guide, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.careerchoiceguide.com/informational-interview-questions.html">http://www.careerchoiceguide.com/informational-interview-questions.html</a> (accessed July 20, 2009).</span>
</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p06">In addition to having your questions ready, also be ready to talk about your brand positioning points (review this concept in the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> section in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>). Use your communication skills to make your experience and interest come alive in the interview. It’s a good idea to offer to show the samples of your work while you are talking about why you are interested in pursuing a career path in the industry.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p07">Take the time to print out your questions so you are organized during the interview. Put your questions and spare copies of your résumé in a professional portfolio or folder. Don’t be afraid to refer to your questions and take notes during the interview; it’s an excellent nonverbal cue that you think what the interviewer has to say is important.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p08">Wrap up your informational interview by asking for your interviewee’s business card. Also, ask for the names of some other people that you might be able to learn from; for example, “I really enjoyed our conversation today, and I learned so much about the industry. You have helped me realize that I would like to pursue a career in sales. Can you give me the names of some other people I might be able to learn from?”</p>

                <p class="simpara">Keep in Touch</p>
                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p09">What about after the informational interview? Keep in touch. People who take the time to help students also want to know what is going on with the young job-seeking population. Send an e-mail or touch base by phone at least every four to six weeks. It’s a great way to develop a relationship and network, even after you land your internship or job. Part of networking is providing exchange, and keeping in touch is your part of the bargain. When you keep in touch, your interviewer might be able to help you in the future; or better yet, you might be able to help her and return the favor.</p>

<em class="emphasis bolditalic">When</em> to Ask for an Informational Interview</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s05_p01">It’s always a good time to meet and learn from experienced people in the industry in which you are interested. However, you should actively pursue informational interviews when you are prepared with your résumé and have compiled some samples of your work. Keep in mind that every contact you make is a selling opportunity for your personal brand so it’s best to be ready as early as possible in your academic career. It’s never too soon to prepare your résumé even as you are building your experience with internships and other jobs. Whenever you meet someone interesting, follow up and ask him for an informational interview so you can learn more about how he got into the business.</p>

<em class="emphasis bolditalic">Where</em> to Have an Informational Interview</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s06_p01">Your interviewee will most likely suggest a location for your meeting; it might be in her office, or you might meet for breakfast or lunch. Some informational interviews might take place by phone. The objective is to connect, learn, and network.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch05_s03_s03_s06_p02">Whatever the location, always prepare and dress for each informational interview as if it were a job interview. Also, always send a thank-you note to thank your interviewer for his time. You should send a thank-you e-mail and a handwritten thank-you note on the same day, so your interviewer will receive your e-mail followed by your handwritten note. That way, you leave a lasting impression and demonstrate your good etiquette.</p>

                    <li>An <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> is an underused career search method that includes a meeting with a professional to learn more about pursuing a career in a specific industry, profession, or job.</li>
                    <li>You go on <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interviews</strong> to learn what it’s like to work in a particular industry, company or job, connect and network with people in the industry, and hone your interviewing skills.</li>
                    <li>One thing you should <em class="emphasis">never</em> do on an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> is ask for a job or internship. If the opportunity presents itself and your interviewer asks if you might be interested, it’s appropriate to say yes. However, you should not be the one to initiate dialogue about the possibility of a position with the company.</li>
                    <li>You should ask anyone who is in the industry or profession that you would like to pursue. It’s a good idea to use your networking skills to identify people with whom you can have an informational interview. Professionals such as guest speakers in class, prominent executives, and those in local professional organizations are ideal people to ask for an informational interview.</li>
                    <li>It’s best to request an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> in person or by phone because you increase your chances for a positive response. You can also request an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> by letter or e-mail.</li>
                    <li>Prepare for an <strong class="emphasis bold">informational interview</strong> as if it were a job interview, even if you already know the person. Research the company, bring extra copies of your résumé and samples of your work, and prepare questions that you would like to discuss.</li>
