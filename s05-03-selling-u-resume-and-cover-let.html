    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_p01">Think about how you first learned about the new Palm Pre smartphone or that Gatorade had changed its name to simply “G.” How did you know that Pre had even more capabilities than the iPhone or that Gatorade was “moving to the next level”? Chances are it was some kind of advertising or public relations that made you aware of these products before you even tried them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_p02">Now think about your personal brand. How will employers know about you and what you have to offer? A résumé and cover letter serve as your “advertising” campaign to prospective employers. Just like there are lots of ads about products and services, there are an overwhelming number of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">résumés</a><span class="glossdef">A summary of a person’s background and experience.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cover letters</a><span class="glossdef">A one-page letter that acts as an introduction to a résumé.</span></span> that employers have to review before inviting someone in for an interview. How do you make yours stand out? How do you increase your chances of being one of the people who are interviewed? How do you use your cover letter and your résumé to get the job you want?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_p03">There are a few important steps to follow to create the résumé and cover letter that will make you different and compelling to a prospective employer. You will use both of these to apply for jobs online and to send to people with whom you are networking, and you will even send them directly to companies for whom you would like to work. You only have an instant (think nanosecond) to make a lasting impression. If you think you only need a résumé to get a job, you should think again. Your cover letter can play an even more important role than your résumé. Here are some steps to help you create a cover letter that gets read and a résumé that gets you the interview. If you already have a résumé and cover letter, it’s worth reviewing this section because you will learn some important tips to improve them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Five Steps for a Résumé That Stands Out</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_p01">Looking for the right job to start your career is a process that includes preparing your résumé and cover letter, getting your cover letter and résumé to the right people, going on interviews, and negotiating and accepting the right offer. You are at the beginning of the process; you’ll learn about the rest of the process throughout the <em class="emphasis">Selling U</em> sections in this book. This section focuses entirely on creating your résumé and cover letter. Keep in mind that the only purpose for a résumé and cover letter is to get an interview. So your résumé and cover letter need to be crafted in a way that tells what your personal brand has to offer, or your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brand story</a><span class="glossdef">The highlights of what your personal brand has to offer to prospective employers.</span></span>, in a concise and compelling way.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 1: Define Your Three Brand Points That Make You Unique and Provide Value to a Prospective Employer</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p01">If this sounds familiar, it should be. This was covered in detail in <a class="xref" href="fwk-125752-ch01#fwk-125752-ch01">Chapter 1 "The Power to Get What You Want in Life"</a>, but it is such an essential concept that it deserves repetition here. If you haven’t identified your three brand points, you should go back and review the section. Your brand points are actually the foundation of your résumé and cover letter; it is in their summary that you compose your brand story.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p02">You might think of creating a résumé that is a chronological summary of your background. This is good, but it is not compelling enough to differentiate yourself amid the sea of résumés. There are two important things to remember when creating your résumé:</p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>Tell your brand story with your brand points.</li>
                <li>Your brand points should be clear at a glance (literally).</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p03">Let’s say your three brand points are leadership experience, academic excellence, and community service. Those three brand points make up your brand story, the story that you want to tell about yourself, so your résumé headings should highlight these areas.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_p04">To see what this means, review the two versions of the same résumé for Julianna Lanely in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 2.7 "Standard Résumé"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_f02">Figure 2.8 "Standard Résumé Incorporating Brand Points"</a>. The first one was written using a standard résumé approach; the second one was built by incorporating her brand points of marketing and event planning experience, academic excellence, and creative mind-set. Can you see the difference? Which résumé do you think is more compelling? Before you create (or refine) your résumé, identify your three brand points.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 2: Choose Your Résumé Format and Font</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p01">Now that you have the foundation of your résumé message (or your three brand points), it’s time to choose a résumé format. Executives in all industries encourage students and young professionals (those who have been working for five years or less) not to exceed one page for your résumé. In some cases, it may be difficult to keep all of your experience and accomplishments to one page, so choose those that best tell your brand story. As one executive said, “It better be worth my while to turn to page two.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_049">Connie Pearson-Bernard, “Careers in Communications Night,” presentation at West Chester University, West Chester, PA, March 23, 2009.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p02">There are several appropriate résumé templates available at your campus career center or in Microsoft Word. The downside to some templates is that they are difficult to adjust or adapt. The most important thing to consider when you are choosing your résumé format is to be sure it is easy for the reader to skim. Some formats with horizontal lines separating the categories, or those with dates that precede company and position information, are harder to skim because the reader has to work too hard to see the brand story. See the comments in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s01_f01">Figure 2.7 "Standard Résumé"</a> to recognize some things to avoid in your résumé.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s02_p04">Once you choose the format you want to use, you should choose a font that you will use for your résumé and cover letter. The font should be easy to read like Arial or Times New Roman (Arial is a bit more contemporary; Times New Roman is more traditional). It’s best to use twelve-point type (or eleven-point at the smallest) for ease of readability. If you need a little more space on your résumé, consider adjusting the margins slightly, keeping at least 0.7 for each margin. You don’t want your résumé to feel crowded or that it is an effort to read.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 3: Choose Your Headings and Put the Most Important Ones First</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p01">Now that you’ve done your groundwork, it’s time to actually create your résumé. Think about your brand points and then determine the headings you want to use. Use headings that help you tell your brand story at a glance. Don’t focus yet on what you will write in each heading; that will be covered in Step 4.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p02">There are some headings that are standard to include such as “Objective,” “Education,” and “Experience,” but other headings should be used to support your brand story. For example, instead of having a heading for “Work Experience,” be more specific and use “Sales Experience” to highlight that if it is one of your brand points.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p03">One of the most critical things to remember is to put the most important things first. Start with a heading for “Objective,” then “Education.” As you gain more experience in your career, your education will move to the bottom. But at this point, it is a key selling point for your brand.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p04">Now, it’s time to put your brand points to work by choosing headings that tell your story. For example, if academic excellence is one of your brand points, you might consider adding a heading after “Education” called “Scholarships and Awards” or “Honors” to highlight honors and awards that demonstrate your academic excellence. This is the ideal place for things like dean’s list, National Honor Society, or any other awards, honors, or scholarships that you have received.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p05">It’s a good idea for your next heading to reflect one of your brand points such as “Leadership Skills” or “Sales Experience” (or any other specific type of experience). If leadership skills are one of your brand points, it’s better to <em class="emphasis">not</em> make the reader go all the way to the bottom of the page to read about your leadership skills under a generic heading called “Activities.” If it’s important to your brand story, bring your skills into focus in the first part of your résumé with a strong heading like “Leadership Skills.” This section could include athletic, school or professional organization, or any other type of leadership position. If you don’t have leadership skills, don’t worry—you still have a lot to offer. Follow your brand points to tell your story.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p06">Next, include your work experience. This is where you can really make your brand story come alive. Don’t be restricted to a traditional chronological order of your jobs. If you have had an internship in marketing, sales, or other area that supports your brand points, make a separate heading for it, such as “Marketing Experience” or “Sales Experience.” If you have had other jobs, you can simply add another heading after it called “Work Experience” below it. Or if your work experience has a common theme, you might want to name your heading “Retail Experience,” “Customer Service Experience,” or “Hospitality Experience.” This approach tells the reader at a glance that you have valuable experience in the area you want to pursue. You should know that employers look for people who have worked in retail and in restaurants because they know that they can sell and work with customers. Use this type of experience to sell yourself.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p07">If you have participated in projects or activities to support the community, you may want to include a heading for “Community Service.” If you have additional activities that are worth noting, you might consider a heading for “Activities.” It’s best to avoid a long list of generic activities at the end of your résumé, so think about how they tell your brand story. It’s best to include your most recent activities. Although you may include some key activities from high school, it’s better if you can replace those with your more recent activities. It’s not necessary to include the dates of your involvement.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p08">It’s a good idea to have a final heading for “Skills” at the end of your résumé. This should include computer software in which you are proficient such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Access, Adobe Acrobat, and others. It’s a good reminder to your prospective employer that you are skilled for any position. Although it may seem second nature to you to use these software products, there are employers who didn’t learn them in school so they may not be aware that you are proficient in them.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p09">A few things that should <em class="emphasis">not</em> be included on your résumé are “References available upon request,” “Hobbies and Activities,” or a photo. Prospective employers expect to check your references, you should have more substantial things to put on your résumé than hobbies and activities, and many companies cannot consider résumés with photos as it would be considered discrimination.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_p10">See Rakeem Bateman’s résumé shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 2.9 "Standard Résumé Incorporating Effective Headings"</a> to see how headings are used effectively to highlight his brand points of leadership skills, sales experience, and a committed work ethic.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Step 4: Write Your Bullet Points</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p01">Once you have determined your headings, it’s time to make your brand points come alive with bullet points under each heading. Bullet points are better than a narrative format because they are easier for the reader to skim. But, since the reader is skimming, each bullet point is that much more important. Keep your bullet points concise, but specific, so that each delivers powerful information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p02">Start with your objective and write a short, specific goal. One sentence is perfect; you don’t have to be flowery or profound. Something that helps the reader understand what you are looking for is best. For example, if you want to get a job in pharmaceutical sales, your objective might be, “To obtain a sales position at a pharmaceutical company.” Or you might want to get a job in an advertising agency so your objective might be, “To obtain a full-time position in account management at an advertising agency.” Short, sweet, to the point, and effective.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p03">For your education, include the formal name of your college or university, city and state, formal degree (e.g., Bachelor of Arts, Communication Studies), and year or expected year of graduation. It’s not necessary to include the range of years you attended school. Now that you are in college, it’s best to remove your high school education. See <a class="xref" href="#fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s03_f01">Figure 2.9 "Standard Résumé Incorporating Effective Headings"</a> for an example of how to list your education. You may be interested to know that your grade point average is not a requirement on a résumé. Generally, if your GPA is 3.5 or above, you may want to include it.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_050">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 156.</span> The fact is most business people don’t recognize the significance of a GPA unless it’s 4.0. So, if academic achievement is one of your brand points, you should consider adding a heading for “Scholarship and Awards” to demonstrate your accomplishments and make them come alive for the reader. If academics aren’t your strong suit, don’t include your GPA; just list your education.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_051">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 156.</span> If you have studied internationally, you might consider a heading or subheading named “International Study.” Include the program name, school, and countries visited, as well as the dates of the travel.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s04_p04">Awards or honors can be listed as bullet points under the “Scholarship and Awards” heading. For experience headings such as “Leadership Experience,” “Sales Experience,” or “Customer Service Experience,” list the name of the company, city and state, your title, and dates of employment. If you use boldface for the company name, it stands out and helps the reader see at a glance where you have worked. The bullet points in these sections are critical to setting yourself apart; they should be concise and specific, but descriptive, and they should focus on accomplishments and contributions, not a listing of activities or tasks. This will most likely take some time to write these bullet points, but it will be time well spent. Consider the difference between these two bullet points to describe a position at a restaurant:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s05_p01">It’s true that some résumés are never even considered because of a typo or grammar error. After you finish your résumé, take a break, and then review it objectively. Does it clearly tell your brand story? Are your brand points the most important topics? If someone read your résumé, what would that person think you have to offer? Make any necessary adjustments. Then spell-check and proofread it carefully. It’s a good idea to ask some people you trust—perhaps at your campus career center, a parent, professor, or mentor—to review and proofread your résumé. You can’t be too cautious.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s05_p02">When you are satisfied that your résumé is perfect, print it on twenty-four-pound paper (you can buy it at your campus bookstore or any office supply store or Web site).</p>

                <p class="para" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s01_s05_p03">It’s best to save your résumé and cover letter in several formats. A Word document is standard for sending résumés and cover letters. However, online job posting boards remove formatting, so it’s best to also save your documents as .txt files in Microsoft Word (File, Save As, for file type choose “Plain Text (*.txt).” Click OK when the dialogue box appears. Check your document to be sure elements are still in place; adjust accordingly, then save). It’s also helpful to save your documents in PDF format by going to Acrobat.com.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_052">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed. (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2008), 224.</span> It’s a good idea to use a file name such as “John Jones Résumé” because it lets the reader know exactly what file he or she is opening and doesn’t give away your working name.<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_053">Kim Richmond, <em class="emphasis">Brand You</em>, 3rd ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s02_p01">If you haven’t prepared a cover letter to send with your résumé, you should consider writing one. According to a recent article in the <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, “Cover letters are still necessary, and in a competitive market they can give you a serious edge if they are written and presented effectively.”<span class="footnote" id="fwk-125752-fn02_054">Phyllis Korkki, “A Cover Letter Is Not Expendable,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, February 15, 2009, business section, 10.</span> A cover letter is key if you need to set yourself apart, whether you are seeking an internship or a full-time position.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-125752-ch02_s03_s02_s01_p01">Maybe you are dreading the thought of writing a cover letter. It’s easier than you think, since you have already identified your brand points. Write a summary statement for each of your three brand points. In other words, if you only had one minute to talk about your three brand points, what would you say about each one? Write two concise sentences for each point. It might be rough right now, but it will become the core of your cover letter.</p>

It’s important to <em class="emphasis">repeat</em> the highlights of your résumé in your cover letter so the reader can see at a glance how you can bring value as a prospective employee. Since you only have a few seconds to “sell” the reader on the fact that you are the right person for the job, you want to introduce the highlights in the cover letter and then provide the details in your résumé. Your cover letter and résumé work together to tell your brand story.</p>

This is the place where you are able to demonstrate you personality and your selling skills. You can make your cover letter a powerful lead-in to your résumé and sell your prospective employer on the reasons why you should come in for an interview. As with your résumé, be sure to spell-check and proofread your cover letter carefully. Review your cover letter and résumé together to be sure your brand story is clear and powerful.

Now that you have your cover letter, you should adapt it and personalize it for every situation. For example, if you are applying for a job that is posted online, adapt the letter to show how your brand points address the needs of the position. You may even want to create one or two new brand points that also define your brand that you can change based on the job posting.</p>
